7. The correct answer is (B) california. My reasoning is as follows: If you want to find millions of ficus, you need to look for a place that has a lot of tropical and subtropical plants. An arboretum, a teapot, an apartment, and a ground are all places that may have some ficus, but they are not the main places where ficus plants are grown. An arboretum may have a few ficus trees or shrubs, a teapot may have a ficus bonsai or miniature, an apartment may have a ficus potted plant or indoor plant, and a ground may have a ficus weed or vine. However, none of these places have millions of ficus plants. California, on the other hand, is a place that has a lot of tropical and subtropical plants, and it is one of the major producers and consumers of ficus plants in the United States. California has millions of ficus plants that are grown for ornamental, medicinal, or edible purposes, such as figs, rubber plants, or laurels.

However, none of these places have millions of jellyfish. Sea water, on the other hand, is a place that has a lot of aquatic and marine life, and it is the natural habitat of jellyfish.
