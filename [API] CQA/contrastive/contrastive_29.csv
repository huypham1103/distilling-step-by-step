People didn't think it would last because despite a desire to move forward, the rebuilding was difficult and there was a lot of turmoil, which means a state of confusion, disorder, or trouble. The other choices do not fit the question. Love and understanding are positive feelings that would support peace, not undermine it. Fighting is a synonym for war, which contradicts the idea of peace.

The kitchen is a room where food is prepared and cooked, which could contain a sink, but is not the same as a sink.

","6. The most likely answer is **(C) corn fields**. The weasel had stolen the chicken eggs from the farm, which means that the weasel was a thief and the farm was a place where chickens and other animals were raised. It made its escape through the tall corn fields, which are crops that grow on the farm and have long stalks that can hide the weasel. The other choices are not sensible in this context. Chicken coop is a structure where chickens are kept, which is where the weasel stole the eggs from, not where it escaped to. Children's story is a type of literature that is written for young readers, which is not a physical location.

The other choices are not appropriate in this context. Law office is a place where lawyers work and handle legal matters, which is not a natural habitat for weasels. In the car is a location inside a vehicle that is used for transportation, which is not a permanent home for weasels. Backyards are areas behind houses that are usually used for gardening or recreation, which are not secluded or secure for weasels.
