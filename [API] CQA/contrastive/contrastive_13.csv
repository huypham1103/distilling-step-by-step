Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","1. The most likely answer is **(E) friend's house**. This is because if James's stove didn't work, he would need another place to cook that has a working stove. A bathroom, a tent, and a living room are not suitable places for cooking. An apartment is too vague, as it could be his own or someone else's. A friend's house is the most specific and reasonable option.

It only gave him what?', among the choices headache, better understanding, papercuts, enlightened discovering truth, which is the most likely answer? Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","2. The most likely answer is **(A) headache**. This is because analyzing all the data would be a tedious and stressful task, and it did not help James learn more. A headache is a common result of such an activity. A better understanding, an enlightenment, and a discovery of truth are positive outcomes that contradict the question. Papercuts are possible, but not very likely or relevant.

What might she have done while listening?', among the choices remake, copy, simile, derivative reproduction, which is the most likely answer? Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","3. The most likely answer is **(D) derivative**. This is because a derivative is something that is based on or imitates another work, and that is what James's story was. A remake and a reproduction are similar, but they imply that James intentionally copied the original work, which is not the case. A copy is too literal, as it means an exact replica. A simile is a figure of speech that compares two things, and it is not related to the question.

Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","4. The most likely answer is **(C) hollowness**. This is because hollowness is the opposite of solidity, and it is something that can be heard when rapping on a surface. Openness, instability, and weakness are not sounds, but qualities. Strange sounds are too vague and could mean anything.

Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","5. The most likely answer is **(D) sit down**. This is because sit down is the most common and logical thing to do at a lunch table. Fall down and lie down are unlikely and abnormal actions. Sitting down and go ahead are grammatically incorrect, as they should be in the past tense.

He kept adding wood to it, building it bigger and bigger, until it became a what?', among the choices shelterbelt, tree, house, home bus stop, which is the most likely answer? Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","6. The most likely answer is **(C) house**. This is because a house is a large and permanent structure that can be made of wood and used as a shelter. A shelterbelt is a row of trees or shrubs that protect an area from wind or erosion. A tree is a plant that grows from wood, not the other way around. A home is a subjective concept that depends on one's feelings and attachments, not the size or material of the shelter. A bus stop is a public place where people wait for buses, not a shelter made of wood.

Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","7. The most likely answer is **(C) entertained**. This is because entertainment is a common reason for using television, especially after a hard day of work. Laziness, falling asleep, visual, and conformity are not reasons, but states or traits that may or may not be associated with television.

Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","8. The most likely answer is **(E) resort**. This is because a resort is a place where people go for relaxation and recreation, and it often has facilities such as hot tubs, spas, pools, etc. A country club, a health centre, and a hospital are also places where people may use hot tubs, but they are not as common or desirable as a resort. A backyard is not a place, but a part of a place, and it does not imply that the neighbors would want to use the hot tub.

Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","9. The most likely answer is **(B) tide pool**. This is because an anemone is a marine animal that lives in tide pools, which are shallow pools of seawater that form on rocky shores. A flower shop, a flower pot, and a seafood restaurant are places where an anemone would not survive or bloom. A pool is too general, as it could be fresh or salt water, and it does not have the natural environment that an anemone needs.

Where might he have been?', among the choices hotel, guest room, office, apartment house, which is the most likely answer? Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","10. The most likely answer is **(D) apartment**. This is because an apartment is a small and limited space that may not have enough room for guests, and that is why James bought a hide bed sofa. A hotel, a guest room, and a house are larger and more spacious places that would not require a hide bed sofa. An office is not a place where people usually stay over or sleep."

","1. The most likely answer is **(E) commercial building**. James wanted to build a new concert hall, but his land wasn't zoned for commercial use. Zoning is the process of dividing land into zones that regulate the types of buildings and activities that are allowed in each area. A concert hall is a type of commercial building that usually requires a special permit or approval from the local authorities. The other choices are not relevant to zoning, as they are either types of performances (theater, orchestras), locations (city, university building), or not related to building at all.

","2. The most likely answer is **(B) city**. James wanted to build a new strip mall, but he wanted a lot of traffic. He decided to build it in a high density residential area, where there are many people living in close proximity. A city is a type of high density residential area that typically has a lot of traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian. A strip mall is a type of shopping center that consists of a row of stores along a road or highway. The other choices are not likely to have a lot of traffic, as they are either low density residential areas (suburbs, suburban town), uninhabited areas (the desert), or not locations at all (vacant stores).

He started a new construction project that blocked the parade route and caused a lot of inconvenience and frustration for the participants and spectators. A new construction is a type of activity that involves building something new, such as a house, a road, or a bridge. The other choices are not likely to ruin the parade, as they are either positive or neutral actions (found, fix, construct, produce), or not actions at all.

He would look for one in a populated area, where there are many people living and working. A populated area is a type of location that has a high density of population, such as a city, a town, or a village. The other choices are not likely to have a megachurch, as they are either too specific (city, commercial area, christian community), too general (every town), or not locations at all.
