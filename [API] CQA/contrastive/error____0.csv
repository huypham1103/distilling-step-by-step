","1. The most likely answer for the question 'She often spent money she didn't have buying products, this lead to what?' is **(E) debt**. This is because spending money that one does not have means borrowing money from others or using credit cards, which will result in owing money to others or paying interest. This will create a situation of debt, which is the state of owing money. The other choices are not logical consequences of spending money that one does not have. Spending money is the action, not the result. Owning means having something as one's property, which is not necessarily the case for buying products. Pleasure is a feeling, not a situation. Surplus of cash means having more money than needed, which is the opposite of the scenario.
