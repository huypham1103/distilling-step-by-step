Explain the cause-and-effect relationship between the question and your chosen answer.
","10. The correct answer is **(E) airplane**. The cause-and-effect relationship is that an airplane is a small vehicle that uses a hand throttle to control the speed of the engine, and foot pedals to control the direction of the rudder and the ailerons, which are parts of the wings that help steer the plane. A car, a fuel system, an accelerate, and a boat are not vehicles that have the same configuration of controls, and they do not match the description of the question."
