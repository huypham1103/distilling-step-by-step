Explain the cause-and-effect relationship between the question and your chosen answer.
","1. The correct answer is **(D) falling asleep**. James was sitting quietly because I was having trouble doing something.

Therefore, he was not doing something that would make noise or require movement, such as playing games or expressing discomfort or anxiety. Solitude is not something that one does, but a state of being alone. Falling asleep is something that one does not do easily when sitting quietly, unless one is very tired or bored.
