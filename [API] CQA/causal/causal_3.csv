A tool shed, a hardware store, a construction worker's vehicle, and a library are not places where Billy would normally find a stepladder, or where he would be allowed to take one without permission.

Opening his mouth is a necessary action for talking, but he doesn't want to do it because he fears that the gnats will enter his mouth or bother him. The other choices are not reasons why no one can hear him. Will listen is a verb phrase that describes the attitude of the listener, not the speaker.
