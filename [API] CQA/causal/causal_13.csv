","9. The correct answer is **(E) grateful**. James wasn't a bad person, but he was bitter due to being trapped in a wheelchair. James wished he could be more grateful. This means that he wanted to appreciate what he had, instead of focusing on what he lacked. Grateful is the opposite of bitter, so this creates a contrast between James's attitude and his desire. The cause-and-effect relationship is that James wished he could be more grateful because he was bitter due to being trapped in a wheelchair.

Explain the cause-and-effect relationship between the question and your chosen answer.
","10. The correct answer is **(A) refrigerator**. James wasn't a repair person, but even he knew that he didn't need a freon coin in a refrigerator. This means that he knew that a freon coin was a useless or fake item that had nothing to do with a refrigerator. A refrigerator is a device that uses a refrigerant, such as freon, to cool and preserve food. A freon coin is a nonsensical term that sounds like a scam or a joke. The cause-and-effect relationship is that James knew he didn't need a freon coin in a refrigerator because he had some common sense or knowledge."

","1. The correct answer is **(D) organization**. James needed something to lead, such as a group of people, a team, or a project. An organization is a general term that can refer to any of these. A battle, an army, a company, or a school are more specific examples of organizations, but they are not the only ones.

","2. The correct answer is **(E) suitcase**. James packed everything into a single object that he could take with him to outer space. A suitcase is a common object that people use to pack their belongings when they travel. A universe, a jar, a box, or a closet are not objects that James could pack his things into or take with him to outer space. The cause-and-effect relationship is that James needed a convenient and portable object to store his things for his trip.

Explain the cause-and-effect relationship between the question and your chosen answer.
","3. The correct answer is **(B) in motion**. James's bouncing rubber balls were at rest when he was sleeping, which means they were not moving. He would get up in the morning and make them bounce again, which means he would put them in motion. In motion is the opposite state of being at rest. Upside down, active, wakefulness, or resthold are not states that describe the movement of the balls. The cause-and-effect relationship is that James liked to play with his bouncing rubber balls and make them move.

","4. The correct answer is **(C) bus station**. James's duffel bag was too heavy to carry with him, so he left it somewhere where he could retrieve it later or have someone else pick it up for him. A bus station is a place where people can leave their luggage for a short time or send it to another destination. A bag lady's shopping cart, an army barracks, a locker room, or a transit are not places where James could safely or easily leave his duffel bag. The cause-and-effect relationship is that James needed a convenient and secure place to leave his heavy bag.

","5. The correct answer is **(A) wishing well**. James's parents felt that he was wasting his money, but they still let him put a coin somewhere every weekend where he could make a wish. A wishing well is a place where people can throw coins and hope that their wishes come true. A piggy bank, a change purse, or a parking meter are places where people can save or spend their money, but they do not have anything to do with making wishes. Eat cake is not a place at all.

","6. The correct answer is **(A) gain weight**. Jamie wanted to reduce her waist size, but all of her efforts failed miserably. She continued to do something that had the opposite effect of what she wanted. To gain weight means to increase one's body mass or fat, which would make one's waist size larger. Augment, make larger, or expand are synonyms of gain weight, but they are not as specific or common. Dispare is a misspelling of despair, which means to lose hope or confidence, but it does not have anything to do with one's waist size. The cause-and-effect relationship is that Jamie did not achieve her desired outcome and instead experienced the opposite.

","8. The correct answer is **(A) memorize**. Jane has a desire to learn every animal's taxonomic name on the planet, which means she wants to know the scientific names that classify each animal into groups.

Visit museum, understand better, attend school, or read book are actions that Jane could do to help her learn the taxonomic names, but they are not enough by themselves. She still needs to memorize them. The cause-and-effect relationship is that Jane wants to achieve a challenging goal that requires a lot of memory.

Anything is the most appropriate answer because it covers all the possible contents of the box.
