Doing drugs is an activity that involves consuming or injecting substances that alter one's mood, perception, or behavior, usually illegally or harmfully. Going to a party in an alley, which is a narrow passage between buildings, may indicate that one is involved in doing drugs, as it is a secluded and shady place where drug dealers or users may gather.
