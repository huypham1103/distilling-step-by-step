    - The most probable answer is **(C) wheeze**, which means make a high-pitched sound when breathing due to a blockage or inflammation in the airways. Wheezing is a common sign of lung problems, such as asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia. A doctor can usually hear wheezing with a stethoscope or by listening closely to the patient's chest.
    - The other options are not appropriate or accurate. Inhaling and inhale are the same word, and they are part of the normal process of breathing, not a problem or a symptom. Cough is a possible answer, but it is not as specific or as indicative of lung problems as wheeze. Inhale and exhale is a redundant and unnecessary phrase, as it simply describes the basic function of breathing.
