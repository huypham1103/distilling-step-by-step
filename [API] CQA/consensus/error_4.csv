The question describes a scenario where Lilly is having a romantic and intimate moment with John, which is likely to cause her pleasure.

Cleanliness is a state of being free from dirt or germs, which can be achieved by bathing, but not necessarily by bathing five times a day. Dry skin is a condition where the skin lacks moisture or oil, which can be a consequence of bathing too often, but it is not the only possible outcome. Nudity is a state of being without clothes or covering, which is usually required for bathing, but it is not a result of bathing. Tension to ease is a phrase that means a reduction of stress or anxiety, which can be a benefit of bathing, but not a negative effect.

This can reduce the cost of production and increase the profit margin for businesses. Europe is a continent that consists of many countries, each with its own tax system and regulations, so it is not a specific or uniform place for building a factory. An industrial complex is a group of buildings or facilities that are used for manufacturing or processing, which can be located in any place, not necessarily with low taxes. Workers are people who perform labor or services for a wage or salary, who are not a type of place, but a factor of production. Russia is a country that spans across Europe and Asia, which has its own tax system and regulations, which may or may not be favorable for building a factory.
