He didn't enjoy television much but had no one to interact with, so he'd spend his free time doing what?' with options watch film, play cards, surf net, talking on the phone see favorite show? Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","1. The most likely answer is **(C) surf net**. John did not enjoy television much, so he would not watch film or see favorite show.

","3. The most likely answer is **(C) office supply store**. John lost his appointment book somewhere and he does not want to bother looking for it.

He thought that the door was shut, but he eventually realized that there was no door, and that the light source that was blinding his eyes was very familiar. He was on his back looking at the sky.

He went out and looked for it in what?' with options closet, basement, post office, water garage is **(B) basement**.

How would you describe the area where he lives?' with options farming community, rural area, cow's shed, michigan housing farmer and family is **(B) rural area**. This is because rural areas are sparsely populated and often have farms or agricultural land. A farming community implies that there are other farmers nearby, which is not the case for John. A cow's shed is a structure, not an area. Michigan is a state, not a description of an area. Housing farmer and family is not a grammatical phrase.

","6. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'John looked for beavers but couldn't find any, because he lived where?' with options america, australia, countryside, dictionary woodlands is **(B) australia**. This is because beavers are not native to Australia, and are unlikely to be found there in the wild. Beavers are found in North America and Eurasia, especially in areas with rivers, lakes, or wetlands. The countryside and woodlands are habitats that could support beavers, depending on the location. A dictionary is a book, not a place.

Where might he avoid going?' with options pet store, parking lot, woodland, north america park is **(A) pet store**. This is because pet stores are often criticized for selling animals that are bred in poor conditions, or sourced from unethical suppliers. John might avoid going to pet stores to avoid supporting animal abuse, or seeing animals in distress. Parking lots, woodlands, North America, and parks are not places that are inherently associated with animal abuse.
