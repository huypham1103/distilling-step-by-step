","1. The most likely answer is (C) surf net. John had a lot of free time and no one to interact with, so he might have used the internet to find information, entertainment, or socialization.

","6. The most likely answer is (A) sky. John heard a language that he could not understand and thought that the door was shut, but he realized that there was no door and that the light source was very familiar.
