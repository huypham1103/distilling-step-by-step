Billy are cheeseburgers more often than some people, but less often than others.  You could say that it was something he did only when?' is **(A) occasionally**. This is because the word 'occasionally' means 'sometimes but not often', which matches the description of Billy's cheeseburger eating habits.

Where might he have been?' is **(D) north dakota**. This is because North Dakota is a state in the US that has a dry climate and a low population of foxes.

","4. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy tried to arise, but he could not stand from bed. He continued to do what?' is **(B) lie flat**. This is because the phrase 'lie flat' means 'to remain in a horizontal position', which is what Billy did after failing to get up. The other choices do not describe Billy's action correctly, as they either imply movement or a different posture (fall down, get down, lay down, sitting down).

","5. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy tried to defeat John, but John was just too good.  It seemed that billy could never achieve what?' is **(E) victory**. This is because the word 'victory' means 'an act of defeating an enemy or opponent in a battle, game, or other competition', which is what Billy wanted but could not get.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","6. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy wanted to return home, but his mother told him to do what?' is **(E) go away**. This is because the phrase 'go away' means 'to leave a place or person', which is what Billy's mother told him to do. The other choices do not match Billy's mother's words, as they either have different implications or are not grammatically correct (run away, leave, going away, backspace).

","7. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy wants to learn how to socialize, but he doesn't know where to start.  He calls his best friend and asks for what?' is **(D) input**. This is because the word 'input' means 'advice or information', which is what Billy needed from his best friend. The other choices do not fit Billy's request, as they either have different purposes or are not something that can be asked for (have friends, meet new people, entertainment, friendship).

","8. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy wants to understand people better.  He's a very big-hearrted person,  He has a lot of what?' is **(C) compassion**. This is because the word 'compassion' means 'sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others', which is a quality that Billy had as a big-hearted person. The other choices do not describe Billy's trait well, as they either have different aspects or are not something that can be measured (peace, love, friendships, satisfaction).

","10. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy was a human, and he had human bodily functions.  He needed to catch his flight but ended up missing it, because he had too much mexican and was stuck where?' is **(C) bathroom**. This is because the word 'bathroom' means 'a room containing a toilet and sink and typically also a bathtub or shower', which is where Billy was trapped due to his digestive issues.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","1. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy was a kooky person, but he wasn't gay.  What was he?' is **(C) straight**. This is because the word 'gay' is often used to refer to someone who is attracted to the same sex, while the word 'straight' is used to refer to someone who is attracted to the opposite sex. Therefore, if Billy wasn't gay, he was most likely straight.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","2. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy was cogitating the situation, but soon he would have to come to what?' is **(A) decision**.

","3. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy was was going on a long vacation, but before he did he got a bite to eat.  Where might he have eaten?' is **(E) gas station**. This is because the other options are either unlikely or impractical places to eat before going on a long vacation. A space shuttle, a friend's house, and Disneyland are not easily accessible or convenient locations for a quick meal. A supermarket might have some food options, but they are usually not prepared or cooked. A gas station, on the other hand, often has snacks, drinks, and sometimes hot food that can be purchased and consumed on the go.

","4. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy wasn't a stranger, but they hadn't spoken to him often, either.  How would you describe him?' is **(B) known person**. This is because the other options are either too close or too distant to describe Billy's relationship with them. A family member, a friend, and a relative are usually people that they would speak to more often or have a stronger bond with. A crowd is a large group of people that they would not know individually or personally. A known person is someone that they recognize or are familiar with, but do not have a frequent or intimate contact with.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","5. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy's boss told him to get a book from a high shelf, so he took a stepladder from what?' is **(A) store room**. This is because the other options are either irrelevant or inappropriate places to get a stepladder from. A tool shed, a hardware store, and a construction worker's vehicle are not likely to be located near a place where books are stored or displayed. A library might have some books, but it is not a place where one can borrow or take a stepladder without permission. A store room is a place where various items or equipment are kept or stored, and it is possible that a stepladder is one of them.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","6. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Billy's disability prevented him from moving, but it didn't alter his mind or what?' is **(D) competency**. This is because the other options are either unrelated or affected by Billy's disability. Activity, potence, and strength are all aspects of physical ability or performance, which are likely to be impaired by Billy's disability. Qualification is a formal or official recognition of one's skills or knowledge, which may or may not depend on Billy's disability. Competency is the ability or capacity to do something effectively or successfully, which can be independent of Billy's disability. Therefore, if Billy's disability didn't alter his mind, it also didn't alter his competency.

Billy needed money so that he could do what?' is **(E) buy food**. This is because the other options are either unnecessary or unrelated to Billy's situation. Going on a date, paying bills, getting things, and controlling people are not directly related to Billy's problem of not being able to cook or heat his food. Buying food, on the other hand, is a logical and practical solution to Billy's dilemma, as he can purchase ready-made or take-out food that does not require cooking or microwaving.

This is because the other options are either irrelevant or illogical to Bo's situation. Getting dirty, organizing, sorting, and soaping are not actions that Bo would need to do to his dirty clothes before putting on his clean ones. Taking off, however, is a necessary and sensible step that Bo would have to do to his dirty clothes before changing into his clean ones.

The line was fast, but the children in front of them were loud.   They were what?' is **(B) being annoyed**. This is because the other options are either incorrect or inappropriate to describe Bob and Boris's state of mind. Frustration, delays, irritation, and out of order are all nouns, while the question is asking for an adjective or a verb phrase. Being annoyed, however, is a verb phrase that accurately and reasonably expresses Bob and Boris's feeling of displeasure or irritation caused by the loud children in front of them.

This is because the other options are either insufficient or irrelevant to describe Bob's desired stereo system. Decorative, extravagant, speakers, and exotic are all adjectives that can modify a stereo system, but they do not capture the full extent of Bob's preference for a high-end and feature-rich device. Bells and whistles, however, is an idiom that means additional or fancy features or accessories that make something more attractive or appealing. Therefore, if Bob wants something studio quality, he also wants something with all of the bells and whistles."
