Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","1. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'The stove had to be moved so the kitchen could be remodeled, where did it go?' is **(D) friend's house**. This is because a stove is a large and heavy appliance that is used for cooking food. It is not likely to fit in an apartment, a living room, or a restroom. It is also not a boiling liquid like water. Therefore, the most reasonable option is that the stove was moved to a friend's house where it could be stored temporarily until the kitchen was remodeled.

","3. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'The tickets were supposed to arrive by 1AM, but Sally had been standing in queue for the concert since midnight and it was now 2AM and the line hadn't moved. Why was this?' is **(A) delays**. This is because delays are a common reason for why tickets may not arrive on time or why a queue may not move. Delays can be caused by various factors such as technical issues, weather conditions, security checks, or human errors. Delays can also cause frustration, but frustration is not the cause of the problem, but rather the result of it. Sprinting, moving forward, and being annoyed are also not the causes of the problem, but rather the possible reactions to it. Therefore, the most plausible option is that the tickets were delayed and that's why the line hadn't moved.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","4. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'They burned the record, they were trying to do what to history?' is **(E) erase**. This is because burning a record is a way of destroying evidence or information that may be related to history. By burning a record, they may be trying to hide, deny, or forget something that happened in the past. They may also be trying to rewrite history, but rewriting implies that they are replacing the original version with a different one, whereas erasing implies that they are removing the original version altogether. A compact disc, a tape, and playing music are not relevant to the question, as they are not actions that can be done to history. Therefore, the most reasonable option is that they were trying to erase history.
