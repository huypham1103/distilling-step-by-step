","10. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'The construction manager was communicating to the concerned financiers of the building, what was he briefing them on?' is **(B) progress**. This is because progress is a word that means the process of developing or improving something, and it is a common topic that a construction manager would brief the financiers of a building on, as it would show the status and quality of the construction project. Collaboration, bulldozer, exchanging ideas, and static are not suitable answers, as they do not describe what the construction manager was briefing the financiers on or are not related to the question."
