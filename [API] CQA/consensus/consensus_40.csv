","1. The most likely answer is (A) feeling comfortable. If you increase the thermostat in your bedroom, you are probably trying to make the room warmer and more cozy. Feeling comfortable is a reasonable outcome of adjusting the temperature to your preference. The other options are less likely or undesirable. You might overheat, increase the temperature, or start a fire if you set the thermostat too high, but that is not a normal or expected result. Pleasure is a vague and subjective term that may or may not be related to the temperature.
