A canteen is a container that is used to carry water or other drinks, especially by soldiers or hikers. It is usually made of metal or plastic and has a cap and a strap. A deli, a kitchen, an office, and a diner are not places where one would put a cup of coffee in, but rather where one would get a cup of coffee from.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","5. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'The hikers were feeling exhaustion, so they sat on a log to what?' is **(B) have rest**. To have rest means to stop doing something that is tiring or stressful and relax or sleep for a while. It is a common phrase that fits the context of the question. To read a book, to run out of steam, to sit down, and to go to sleep are not as appropriate as to have rest, because they either imply a different activity, a different state, a different posture, or a different duration of rest.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","6. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'The hikers were suffering from fatigue on the steep trail, they decided to stop and what?' is **(E) nap**. To nap means to sleep lightly or briefly, especially during the day. It is a suitable word that describes what the hikers did to recover from their fatigue. To sit down, to go to bed, to sleep, and to have rest are not as precise as to nap, because they either do not specify the type of sleep, the location of sleep, the depth of sleep, or the time of sleep.

Feelings are the emotional reactions or attitudes that one has towards something or someone. A hippy is a person who rejects conventional society and values and advocates peace, love, and harmony. Therefore, it makes sense that a hippy would have strong feelings for all humans, regardless of their differences or conflicts. Names, words, naval, and bladders are not relevant to the question.

The big apple is a nickname for New York City, the largest and most populous city in the United States. A toll road is a road that charges a fee for using it, and there are many toll roads in the eastern United States, especially in the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.

","10. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'The hobbit was timid in front of the dragon, but what did he have to be to get the gold?' is **(E) dauntless**. Dauntless means showing fearlessness and determination, especially in the face of danger or difficulty. A hobbit is a fictional creature from the fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien, who are small, hairy, and fond of a simple life. A dragon is a mythical beast that breathes fire and guards treasure. In the novel The Hobbit, the protagonist Bilbo Baggins has to overcome his timidity and be dauntless to steal a gold cup from the dragon Smaug. Mean, aggressive, bellicose, and reckless are not as appropriate as dauntless, because they either imply a negative or violent attitude, or a lack of caution or wisdom."
