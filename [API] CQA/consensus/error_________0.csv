","1. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'Where is the ficus tree native to?' is **(D) tropical forest**. Ficus trees are a genus of plants that include over 800 species of trees, shrubs, and vines. They are native to the tropics and subtropics of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. Some of them are popular as houseplants, such as the weeping fig and the rubber plant, but they are not native to apartments, zoos, or dictionaries. The Middle East is not a tropical region, so ficus trees are not native there either.
