This is because when water evaporates from your skin, it takes away some of your body heat, making you feel colder. Shivering is a possible consequence of becoming cold, but not a direct effect of not using a towel. Shrinkage is a slang term for the reduction of the size of the male genitals due to cold exposure, but it does not affect the whole body. Not drying is a trivial answer, as it does not describe what your body may do. Getting melted is a nonsensical answer, as it implies that your body is made of a substance that can melt at room temperature.

","2. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'If you eat beans when eating dinner, what noise are you likely to make?' is **(D) flatulence**. This is because beans contain complex carbohydrates that are difficult to digest, and they produce gas in the intestines. Flatulence is the medical term for passing gas through the anus, which can make a loud or silent noise. Becoming full is a possible outcome of eating beans, but not a noise. Barfing is a slang term for vomiting, which is not a common reaction to eating beans.

","3. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'If you find a bone wrapped in clothe, where are you?' is **(A) tomb**.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","4. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'If you found yourself explaining what a rook was named a rook, it might be because a child is calling it a what?' is **(E) castle**. This is because a rook is a piece in the game of chess, which has the shape of a tower or a castle. A child might not know the proper name of the piece, and call it a castle instead. Juggling is an activity that involves throwing and catching objects in the air, which has nothing to do with a rook. Trees are plants that have a trunk and branches, which do not resemble a rook. A chess set is a collection of pieces and a board that are used to play chess, which includes a rook, but is not a synonym for it.
