","1. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'If you don't use a towel after getting wet, you body may do what?' is **(C) become cold**. This is because when water evaporates from your skin, it takes away some of your body heat, making you feel colder. Shivering is a possible consequence of becoming cold, but not the direct effect of not using a towel. Shrinkage is a term that refers to the reduction of the size of the external genitalia due to cold exposure, but it is not a general term for the whole body. Not drying is a trivial answer, since it is obvious that if you don't use a towel, you will not dry.

Justify your answer based on general knowledge. 
","2. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'If you eat beans when eating dinner, what noise are you likely to make?' is **(D) flatulence**. This is because beans contain complex carbohydrates that are difficult to digest and produce gas in the intestines. When the gas is expelled through the anus, it makes a sound that is commonly known as farting or flatulence. Becoming full is a possible outcome of eating beans, but not a noise. Barfing is a slang term for vomiting, which is not a typical reaction to eating beans, unless you are allergic or intolerant to them. Indigestion is a discomfort in the stomach or chest that may result from eating beans, but it is not a noise either.

","4. The commonly agreed-upon answer to the question 'If you found yourself explaining what a rook was named a rook, it might be because a child is calling it a what?' is **(E) castle**. This is because a rook is a chess piece that looks like a tower or a castle, and some children may not know its proper name and call it a castle instead. Juggling is an activity that involves throwing and catching objects, not a name for a chess piece. Trees are plants that have trunks and branches, not chess pieces. A chess set is a collection of chess pieces and a board, not a name for a single piece. Flying is an action that involves moving through the air, not a name for a chess piece.

Wanting more is a desire, not a verb. Headaches are pains in the head, not verbs.

This is because an undercover shopper is someone who is paid to buy products and evaluate their quality, service, or performance, and report their findings to the company that hired them. Compare prices is something that an undercover shopper may do before buying products, but not after doing a review. Save money is something that an undercover shopper may want to do with their earnings, but not something that they would do as part of their job.

This is because resentment is a feeling of anger or bitterness towards someone who has done something that is perceived as unfair or undeserved, and a casino owner may feel that way towards a person who has won a lot of money from their establishment. Betrayal is a feeling of being deceived or let down by someone who was trusted or loyal, and a casino owner may not have that kind of relationship with a customer. Get money is something that a casino owner may want to do, but not a feeling. Revenge is a feeling of wanting to harm or punish someone who has done something wrong or harmful, and a casino owner may have that feeling towards a person who has cheated or broken the rules, but not necessarily towards a person who has won legitimately.
