A container can of corn is a metal or plastic container that holds corn kernels that are cooked or preserved. Therefore, a cupboard is a reasonable place where one can keep a container can of corn, especially if they use or consume corn as part of their diet.

A garage, a packet, a liquid, and a pantry are all places where one can find or store a container can of corn, but they are not places where one would typically keep a container can of corn, unless they have a specific reason to do so."
