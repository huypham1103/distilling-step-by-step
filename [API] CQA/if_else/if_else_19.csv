Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","10. The correct answer is (E) abundant. Abundant is what the buffalo are now again after being hunted until they were scarce. Abundant means existing in large quantities or plentiful. The buffalo were hunted until they were scarce, which means they were killed by humans for their meat, fur, or other products until there were very few of them left. But after much effort and many years, they are now abundant again, which means there are many of them living in the wild or in protected areas. A conditional statement that explains this reasoning is: **If the buffalo were hunted until they were scarce, then they were not abundant. If the buffalo were protected and restored, then they became abundant again.**"
