","3. The correct answer is **(C) atlas**. An atlas is a collection of maps that can show the geographical features and locations of different places. An atlas can help you plan your route when driving to the Pacific Ocean by showing you the roads, distances, directions, and landmarks along the way. A drawing is not a reliable source of information for planning a route, as it may not be accurate or detailed enough. San Francisco Bay is a specific location near the Pacific Ocean, but it does not help you plan your route from anywhere else.
