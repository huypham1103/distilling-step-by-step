If there was no natural or artificial light source, then he was likely in a place that was far from the surface of the earth.
Therefore, if John traveled deeper and deeper and the light faded away until it was pitch black, then he was likely in the ocean.

If John walks down an aisle that is full of over the counter medication, then he is in a place where there is a variety of medicine for sale.
If he walks down another aisle with assorted items, toys, candy, and whatnot, then he is in a place where there is a variety of non-food items for sale.

","7. The correct answer is (C) ignoring. A possible explanation is:

If John wanted respect, then he was in a situation where he expected or desired recognition or appreciation from others.
If Lud didn't even act like he was alive, then he was in a situation where he showed no interest or awareness of John's presence or existence.

If John wanted to hunt blowfish, then he was in a situation where he wanted to catch or kill a type of fish that can inflate itself as a defense mechanism.
If he didn't want to leave America, then he was in a situation where he wanted to stay within the boundaries of a country that consists of 50 states and several territories.
If he wanted to stay within the boundaries of a country that consists of 50 states and several territories, then he had a limited range of locations where blowfish can be found.

If John wanted to keep his food fresh, then he was in a situation where he wanted to preserve or maintain the quality or condition of his food.
If he bought something that would let him suck the air out, leaving empty space inside, then he was in a situation where he wanted to create a vacuum or a space devoid of air around his food.

The hypothesis is ""John was a servant, but he was paid for his work"" and the conclusion is ""he was a free person"". A servant is someone who works for another person, usually without pay. A free person is someone who is not enslaved or bound by another person. If John was paid for his work, then he was not a slave or a bound person, so this conditional statement is true.

The hypothesis is ""John was a terrible writer"" and the conclusion is ""to practice, his teacher suggested that he consider people he knows and write letters to them"". Writing letters is a way to practice writing skills, especially if the writer considers the audience and the purpose of the letter. Writing novels, working in an advertising firm, writing notes, or writing poems are not necessarily related to the hypothesis or the conclusion, so this conditional statement is true.

The hypothesis is ""John was an important person, but when wronged he could be petty"" and the conclusion is ""he would hold grudges and seek revenge for minor offenses"". Being petty means being spiteful or mean over trivial matters. An important person is someone who has a high status or influence in society.

The hypothesis is ""John was cleaning out the old house, while there was nothing upstairs, he found a bunch of old stuff in the cellar"" and the conclusion is ""he would have to go down the stairs and explore the basement"". A cellar is a room or space under the ground level of a house, usually used for storage. An old house might have a lot of old stuff in the cellar that was forgotten or left behind by previous owners. A loft, an attic, a museum, or a waste bin are not places where John would find old stuff in the house, so this conditional statement is true.

The hypothesis is ""John was driving to work and running late"" and the conclusion is ""he would experience stress as he walked through the door"". Stress is a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstances. Driving to work and running late is a stressful situation, especially if John has to face the consequences of being late, such as missing a meeting, losing a client, or getting scolded by his boss. Impatience, sadness, anxiety, or boredom are not necessarily the emotions that John would feel as he walked through the door, so this conditional statement is true.

The hypothesis is ""John was driving to work and running late"" and the conclusion is ""he would feel stress"". This is the same as the previous question, except the conclusion is more general and does not specify when or where John would feel stress. Stress is a feeling of pressure or worry that can affect one's physical and mental health. Driving to work and running late is a stressful situation, as explained before. Anxiety, boredom, pressure, or getting there are not the same as stress, although they might be related to it, so this conditional statement is true.

","8. The correct answer is (E) nudity. A conditional statement for this question is: ""If John was going bathing in a public hot spring in Japan, but he was embarrassed, then he wasn't comfortable with nudity."" The hypothesis is ""John was going bathing in a public hot spring in Japan, but he was embarrassed"" and the conclusion is ""he wasn't comfortable with nudity"". A public hot spring, or onsen, is a natural hot water pool that people can bathe in for relaxation or health benefits. In Japan, most public hot springs require the bathers to be nude, and they are usually separated by gender. Some people might feel embarrassed or uncomfortable with being naked in front of strangers, especially if they come from a different culture or have body image issues. Cleanliness, other people, dry skin, or use soap are not the main reasons why John would be embarrassed, so this conditional statement is true.

The hypothesis is ""John was good at singing, usually, but today he couldn't do it"" and the conclusion is ""he had a hoarse voice"". A hoarse voice is a voice that sounds rough, raspy, or weak, usually due to a sore throat, a cold, or overuse of the vocal cords. A hoarse voice can affect one's ability to sing well, especially if the singer needs to hit high notes or sing for a long time. A change in mood, relaxation, a feminine voice, or being heard are not the reasons why John couldn't sing today, so this conditional statement is true.

A conditional statement for this question is: ""If John was living in a big city, it had many roads and a lot of traffic, he liked it, but he didn't appreciate the smell, then he thought that there was too much pollution."" The hypothesis is ""John was living in a big city, it had many roads and a lot of traffic, he liked it, but he didn't appreciate the smell"" and the conclusion is ""he thought that there was too much pollution"". Pollution is the presence of harmful or unwanted substances in the environment, such as smoke, dust, gas, or noise. A big city with many roads and a lot of traffic can produce a lot of pollution, which can affect the air quality and the smell of the city. John might like the city for other reasons, such as the opportunities, the diversity, or the entertainment, but he might not like the pollution that comes with it. Having experiences, happiness, garbage, or death are not the things that John thought there was too much of, so this conditional statement is true."
