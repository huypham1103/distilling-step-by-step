","1. The correct answer is **(D) school**. A theater which only has unpaid actors is likely to be a school theater, where students perform for educational or extracurricular purposes. The other choices are unlikely to have theaters or actors at all. We can use conditional statements to explain our reasoning as follows:

    - If a theater has unpaid actors, then it is not a professional theater.

The other choices are either too small or too sparse to contain a very large amount of air. We can use conditional statements to explain our reasoning as follows:

    - If a place has a very large amount of air, then it has a high air pressure and a high air density.
    - If a place is a park, a train station, a space shuttle, or a house, then it has a low air pressure and a low air density.
    - Therefore, if a place has a very large amount of air, then it is not a park, a train station, a space shuttle, or a house.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","1. The correct answer is (E) downtown area. My reasoning is as follows: If you want to find hundreds of thousands of mailbox, you need to look for a place that has a high population density and a lot of buildings. A porch, a hardware store, a front yard, and a diner are all places that have a limited number of mailbox, and they are not likely to be found in such large numbers. A downtown area, on the other hand, is a place that has many skyscrapers, apartments, offices, and shops, and each of them may have multiple mailbox.

","3. The correct answer is (D) public place. My reasoning is as follows: If you want to find many people standing inside, you need to look for a place that has a large indoor space and a lot of visitors or customers. A school, a supermarket, and a street corner are all places that may have many people, but they are not necessarily standing inside. A school may have people sitting in classrooms, a supermarket may have people walking around or waiting in line, and a street corner may have people outside or in cars.
