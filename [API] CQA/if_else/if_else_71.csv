The hypothesis is ""you are a snake"" and the conclusion is ""you have no legs"". This statement is true because snakes are reptiles that have long, slender bodies and no limbs. They move by slithering or coiling their bodies. The other choices are not features that separate snakes from other reptiles. A tropical forest is a type of habitat, but not all snakes live in tropical forests and not all reptiles that live in tropical forests are snakes.

The hypothesis is ""you are a savvy consumer"" and the conclusion is ""you should scrutinize the proof for the effectiveness of a product that seems too good to be true"". This statement is true because a savvy consumer is someone who is well-informed and smart about making purchases. They should examine the evidence for the claims of a product carefully and critically, especially if the product promises unrealistic or exaggerated results. The other choices are not actions that a savvy consumer should do when being presented with proof for the effectiveness of a product that seems too good to be true. Exasperation is a feeling of frustration or annoyance, but it does not help the consumer evaluate the product. Change of heart is a change of opinion or attitude, but it does not imply that the consumer has done any research or analysis of the product.
