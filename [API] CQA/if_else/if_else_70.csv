Given the question 'What part of a property may be next to a driveway?', which among the choices yard, neighborhood, driving car on, subdivision suburb is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","1. The correct answer is **(A) yard**. A yard is a part of a property that is usually covered with grass, plants, or trees. A driveway is a paved or unpaved path that leads from the street to a garage or parking area. A yard may be next to a driveway, but the other choices are not parts of a property. We can use conditional statements to explain the reasoning:

    - If a part of a property is next to a driveway, then it must be within the boundaries of the property.
    - If a part of a property is within the boundaries of the property, then it cannot be a neighborhood, a subdivision, or a suburb, because these are larger areas that contain many properties.
    - If a part of a property is within the boundaries of the property, then it cannot be a driving car on, because this is an action, not a part of a property.
    - Therefore, if a part of a property is next to a driveway, then it must be a yard.

Given the question 'What part of dogs can you see?', which among the choices pointed ears, fleas, ticks, no consciousness bad breath is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","2. The correct answer is **(A) pointed ears**. Pointed ears are a visible feature of some dogs, such as German shepherds or fox terriers. The other choices are not parts of dogs that can be seen, or are not parts of dogs at all. We can use conditional statements to explain the reasoning:

    - If a part of dogs can be seen, then it must be a physical attribute of dogs.
    - If a part of dogs is a physical attribute of dogs, then it cannot be fleas or ticks, because these are parasites that live on dogs, not parts of dogs.
    - If a part of dogs is a physical attribute of dogs, then it cannot be no consciousness, because this is a mental state, not a physical attribute.
    - If a part of dogs is a physical attribute of dogs, then it cannot be bad breath, because this is a smell, not a physical attribute.
    - Therefore, if a part of dogs can be seen, then it must be pointed ears.

Given the question 'What part of the apple is typically left behind after eating?', which among the choices grocery store, peel, seeds inside, farmers market stems is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","3. The correct answer is **(E) stems**. Stems are the thin, woody parts of apples that connect them to the branches of apple trees. They are typically left behind after eating an apple, because they are hard and inedible. The other choices are not parts of the apple, or are not typically left behind after eating. We can use conditional statements to explain the reasoning:

    - If a part of the apple is typically left behind after eating, then it must be a part of the apple that is not consumed.
    - If a part of the apple is not consumed, then it cannot be a grocery store or a farmers market, because these are places where apples are sold, not parts of the apple.
    - If a part of the apple is not consumed, then it cannot be a peel, because some people eat the peel of the apple, or use it for other purposes, such as making apple cider vinegar.
    - If a part of the apple is not consumed, then it cannot be seeds inside, because some people eat the seeds of the apple, or plant them to grow new apple trees.
    - Therefore, if a part of the apple is typically left behind after eating, then it must be a stem.

Given the question 'What part of the body are lips on?', which among the choices mouth, jars and all faces, kentucky fried chicken, hand human is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","4. The correct answer is **(A) mouth**. A mouth is a part of the body that is used for eating, speaking, and breathing. Lips are the soft, fleshy parts of the mouth that form the opening. The other choices are not parts of the body, or are not where lips are located. We can use conditional statements to explain the reasoning:

    - If a part of the body are lips on, then it must be a part of the body that has lips.
    - If a part of the body has lips, then it cannot be jars and all faces, because these are objects, not parts of the body.
    - If a part of the body has lips, then it cannot be kentucky fried chicken, because this is a food, not a part of the body.
    - If a part of the body has lips, then it cannot be a hand, because a hand does not have lips, but fingers and a palm.

Given the question 'What part of the life-cycle can love never conquer?', which among the choices having sex, pain and suffering, do stupid things, replacements deaths is the correct answer?

","5. The correct answer is **(E) deaths**. Death is the end of life, and it is something that love cannot conquer, because love cannot prevent or reverse death. The other choices are not parts of the life-cycle, or are not things that love cannot conquer. We can use conditional statements to explain the reasoning:

    - If a part of the life-cycle can love never conquer, then it must be a part of the life-cycle that is inevitable and irreversible.
    - If a part of the life-cycle is inevitable and irreversible, then it cannot be having sex, because having sex is a choice and a reversible action.
    - If a part of the life-cycle is inevitable and irreversible, then it cannot be pain and suffering, because pain and suffering are feelings and conditions that can be alleviated or cured by love or other means.
    - If a part of the life-cycle is inevitable and irreversible, then it cannot be do stupid things, because doing stupid things is a behavior and a consequence that can be avoided or corrected by love or other means.
    - If a part of the life-cycle is inevitable and irreversible, then it cannot be replacements, because replacements are alternatives and substitutes that can be found or accepted by love or other means.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","6. The correct answer is **(D) south**. South is a direction that indicates the lower part of a map or a compass. Virginia is a state in the United States that is located in the south of the country, along the Atlantic coast. The other choices are not parts of us, or are not where Virginia is in. We can use conditional statements to explain the reasoning:

    - If a part of us is Virginia in, then it must be a part of us that contains Virginia.
    - If a part of us contains Virginia, then it cannot be north, because north is the opposite direction of south, where Virginia is located.
    - If a part of us contains Virginia, then it cannot be Minnesota, because Minnesota is another state in the United States that is far away from Virginia, in the north-central region of the country.
    - If a part of us contains Virginia, then it cannot be united states, because united states is the name of the country that Virginia is a part of, not a part of the country.
    - If a part of us contains Virginia, then it cannot be virginias, because virginias is not a word, but a plural form of Virginia, which is a singular state.
    - Therefore, if a part of us is Virginia in, then it must be south.

","7. The correct answer is **(B) elapsed time**. Elapsed time is the amount of time that passes between two events or points in time. It is something that passes between the point of one destination to another, because it measures the duration of the journey. The other choices are not things that pass between the point of one destination to another, or are not things that can pass at all. We can use conditional statements to explain the reasoning:

    - If something passes between the point of one destination to another, then it must be something that can change or move.
    - If something can change or move, then it cannot be relaxation, because relaxation is a state of being calm and comfortable, not something that can change or move.
    - If something can change or move, then it cannot be obstacle, because obstacle is a thing that blocks or hinders progress, not something that can change or move.
    - If something can change or move, then it cannot be uneasiness, because uneasiness is a feeling of anxiety or discomfort, not something that can change or move.

    - If a past time are people engaged in when they are traveling along liquid, then it must be a past time that involves liquid.
    - If a past time involves liquid, then it cannot be question authority, because question authority is an action that involves challenging or criticizing the power or legitimacy of someone or something, not liquid.
