If Sarah wanted to marry, then she would not have to wait until she was an adult, because the legal age of marriage varies by country and culture. If Sarah wanted to dress himself, then she would not have to wait until she was an adult, because dressing oneself is a basic skill that children learn. If Sarah wanted to drive train, then she would not have to wait until she was an adult, because driving train is a profession that requires training and certification. Therefore, the only choice that makes sense is drive car, which is a common activity that requires being an adult in most places.

Where might she be?', which among the choices city, garden, public place, home rome is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","4. The correct answer is (C) public place. The reasoning is as follows: If Sarah drank from a water fountain, then she would be in a place that has water fountains. If Sarah was in a city, then she could drink from a water fountain, but it would not be a unique feature of the city. If Sarah was in a garden, then she could drink from a water fountain, but it would not be a common feature of the garden. If Sarah was in a home, then she would not drink from a water fountain, because homes usually have faucets or taps. If Sarah was in Rome, then she could drink from a water fountain, but it would not be a specific location. Therefore, the only choice that makes sense is public place, which is a general term for a place that is open and accessible to everyone and that often has water fountains.

What might her business have been?', which among the choices bunkrupt, real estate, stock market, bank treasure chest is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","5. The correct answer is (B) real estate. The reasoning is as follows: If Sarah expected to make a fortune on her new business, then she would invest in a business that has high potential returns. If Sarah's business was bunkrupt, then she would not make a fortune, because bunkrupt means being in a state of financial ruin. If Sarah's business was stock market, then she would not go broke because no one could get money to buy, because stock market is a place where people trade shares of companies and other assets. If Sarah's business was bank, then she would not go broke because no one could get money to buy, because bank is an institution that lends and borrows money and charges interest. If Sarah's business was treasure chest, then she would not go broke because no one could get money to buy, because treasure chest is a container that holds valuable items and is usually hidden or guarded. Therefore, the only choice that makes sense is real estate, which is a business that involves buying and selling land and buildings and that can be affected by economic conditions and consumer demand.

She was very what?', which among the choices inaccurate, dull, inelegant, complimentary boring is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","6. The correct answer is (E) boring. The reasoning is as follows: If Sarah had a sharp mind, then she would have a keen intellect or intelligence. If Sarah wasn't social, then she would not enjoy or seek the company of others. If Sarah was inaccurate, then she would not have a sharp mind, because inaccurate means being wrong or mistaken. If Sarah was dull, then she would not have a sharp mind, because dull means being lacking in interest or excitement. If Sarah was inelegant, then she would not have a sharp mind, because inelegant means being lacking in grace or style. If Sarah was complimentary, then she would not be unsocial, because complimentary means being expressing praise or admiration. Therefore, the only choice that makes sense is boring, which means being tedious or uninteresting.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","7. The correct answer is (B) tension. The reasoning is as follows: If Sarah knew she was committing perjury, then she would be lying under oath in a court of law. If Sarah felt a lot of feeling between her and the prosecutor, then she would have a strong emotion or sensation that relates to the prosecutor. If Sarah felt arrest, then she would not have a feeling, because arrest is an action of detaining or capturing someone. If Sarah felt shame, then she would not have a feeling between her and the prosecutor, because shame is a feeling of guilt or disgrace that relates to oneself. If Sarah felt attraction, then she would not have a feeling between her and the prosecutor, because attraction is a feeling of liking or being drawn to someone that relates to the other person. If Sarah felt embarrassment, then she would not have a feeling between her and the prosecutor, because embarrassment is a feeling of awkwardness or discomfort that relates to a situation.

After she quit, she'd take long drives for what?', which among the choices smoke, getting somewhere, relaxation, take a break wreak is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","8. The correct answer is (C) relaxation. The reasoning is as follows: If Sarah liked driving cars more than she liked cigarettes, then she would enjoy or prefer the activity of operating a vehicle. If Sarah quit cigarettes, then she would stop smoking or using tobacco products. If Sarah took long drives for something, then she would travel by car for a purpose or a benefit. If Sarah took long drives for smoke, then she would not quit cigarettes, because smoke is a product of burning or combustion. If Sarah took long drives for getting somewhere, then she would not take long drives, because getting somewhere is a destination or a goal. If Sarah took long drives for take a break, then she would not take long drives, because take a break is a pause or a rest. If Sarah took long drives for wreak, then she would not like driving cars, because wreak is a verb that means to cause damage or destruction.

Given the question 'Sarah loved birds, but when they flew overhead she was covered with what?', which among the choices roof, sky, grieve, poop molt is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","9. The correct answer is (D) poop. The reasoning is as follows: If Sarah loved birds, then she would have a strong affection or admiration for the feathered animals. If birds flew overhead, then they would be in the air above Sarah. If Sarah was covered with something, then she would have a substance or a material on her body or clothes. If Sarah was covered with roof, then she would not be under the birds, because roof is a structure that covers the top of a building. If Sarah was covered with sky, then she would not be covered with anything, because sky is the space that surrounds the earth. If Sarah was covered with grieve, then she would not be covered with anything, because grieve is a verb that means to feel sorrow or sadness. If Sarah was covered with molt, then she would not be covered with anything, because molt is a verb that means to shed feathers or skin.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","10. The correct answer is (B) villa. The reasoning is as follows: If Sarah rented a cabin in the woods, then she would pay money to use a small wooden house in a forested area. If the cabin was so large and spacious that it felt more like something, then it would resemble or imitate another type of building. If the cabin felt more like a palace, then it would not be in the woods, because palace is a large and luxurious residence that is usually in a city or a town. If the cabin felt more like a spacecraft, then it would not be a cabin, because spacecraft is a vehicle that travels in outer space. If the cabin felt more like a hall, then it would not be a cabin, because hall is a large and long room that is used for meetings or events. If the cabin felt more like a liner, then it would not be a cabin, because liner is a large and fast ship that carries passengers or cargo.
