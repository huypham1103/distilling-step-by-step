Given the question 'The country didn't want to join the union. They felt that doing so would reduce them to the status of a what?', which among the choices province, plebian, workplace, detroit construction business is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","7. The correct answer is (A) province. A province is a political division of a country that has its own government and laws, but is subject to the authority of the central or federal government. A union is a group of countries or states that agree to cooperate or unite for a common purpose or benefit. A country is a large area of land that has its own government, laws, and people. To join means to become a member or a part of something. To reduce means to make something smaller or less. To feel means to have an emotion or a sensation. A status is a position or a rank that someone or something has in relation to others. Therefore, if the country didn't want to join the union, and they felt that doing so would reduce them to the status of a province, it means that the country did not want to become a part of the group of countries or states, and they thought that doing so would make them lose their autonomy or sovereignty and become subordinate or dependent on the central or federal government. We can write this as a conditional statement: If the country didn't want to join the union, and they felt that doing so would reduce them to the status of a province, then the country valued their independence and authority.
