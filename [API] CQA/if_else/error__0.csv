","10. The correct answer is (E) foreign. My reasoning is: If the station was local, but Sarah could pick up signals from foreign places.

","1. The correct answer is (C) fridge. A poster is a flat piece of paper that can be attached to a surface with tape or glue. A shelf, a closet, a drawer, and a table are not likely places to put a poster because they are either too small, too crowded, or too exposed to damage. A fridge is a large, smooth, and magnetic surface that can hold a poster easily. Therefore, if James had a poster in his kitchen, it might have been on his fridge.

A pleasure garden may have features such as fountains, statues, pavilions, mazes, and exotic plants.

A palace is a large and luxurious building that belongs to a royal or noble family. A palace may have a pleasure garden as a part of its grounds to impress guests and enjoy leisure activities. Therefore, if a pleasure garden originated somewhere, it might have been in a palace. We can write the conditional statement as follows:

Given the question 'Where is a snake likely to startle a farmer?', which among the choices tropical forest, tree, pet shops, book store feild, is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","3. The correct answer is (E) field. A snake is a legless, scaly, and venomous reptile that lives in warm and humid habitats. A tropical forest, a tree, and a pet shop are places where a snake might be found, but they are not likely to startle a farmer because they are either natural, familiar, or controlled environments. A book store is a place where a snake is unlikely to be found, but it is also unlikely to startle a farmer because it is an indoor and urban setting. A field is a large and open area of land that is used for growing crops or raising animals. A field is a place where a farmer might work, but it is also a place where a snake might hide or hunt. Therefore, if a snake startled a farmer, it might have been in a field. We can write the conditional statement as follows:

Given the question 'Where is an apple tree likely found in abundance?', which among the choices south pole, park, vineyard, farmland orchid, is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","4. The correct answer is (E) orchard. An apple tree is a type of fruit tree that produces apples, which are edible and nutritious fruits. A south pole, a park, a vineyard, and a farmland are places where an apple tree might be found, but they are not likely to have an abundance of apple trees because they are either too cold, too public, too specialized, or too diverse. An orchard is a place where fruit trees are planted and cultivated in large numbers. An orchard is a place where an apple tree is likely to be found in abundance because it is a suitable and dedicated environment. Therefore, if an apple tree was found in abundance somewhere, it might have been in an orchard. We can write the conditional statement as follows:

Given the question 'Where is someone likely to get cold on a balcony?', which among the choices theater, new orleans, michigan, theatre antartica, is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","5. The correct answer is (E) Antarctica. A balcony is a platform that projects from the wall of a building and is surrounded by a railing or a balustrade. A balcony is a place where someone might enjoy the view, the breeze, or the sun. A theater, a New Orleans, a Michigan, and a theatre are places where a balcony might be found, but they are not likely to make someone cold because they are either indoors, warm, moderate, or spelled differently. Antarctica is a continent that covers the south pole of the Earth and is covered by ice and snow. Antarctica is a place where a balcony is unlikely to be found, but it is also a place where someone is likely to get cold because it is extremely cold and windy. Therefore, if someone got cold on a balcony, it might have been in Antarctica. We can write the conditional statement as follows:

`If someone got cold on a balcony, then it might have been in Antarctica.`

Given the question 'Where is someone likely to store their comforter?', which among the choices livingroom, cedar chest, bedroom, world living room, is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","6. The correct answer is (B) cedar chest. A comforter is a thick and fluffy blanket that is used for warmth and comfort. A living room, a bedroom, a world, and a livingroom are places where a comforter might be used, but they are not likely to be places where a comforter is stored because they are either too exposed, too occupied, too vague, or too misspelled. A cedar chest is a type of wooden chest that is made of cedar wood, which has a pleasant smell and repels insects.
