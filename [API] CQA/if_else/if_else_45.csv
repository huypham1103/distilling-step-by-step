My reasoning is as follows: If Joe was in California for vacation and saw a marmot, then he must be in a specific place in California where marmots live. Marmots are large rodents that live in mountainous regions. Great outdoors, north america, and los angeles are not specific enough to be the correct answer, as they could refer to many places in California or elsewhere. Mountainous region is specific, but it is not a place name. Sierra Nevada mountains, however, is a specific place name that refers to a mountain range in California where marmots live.

Bedroom, hotel, restaurant, and zoo are not likely to have both types of flooring, and they are not very fun or exciting places to go with friends.
