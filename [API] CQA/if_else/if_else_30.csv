Given the question 'Though the negotiation was hard, the two sides found a solution that was what?', which among the choices hexachord, bearable, food, agreeable easy is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","1. The correct answer is **(D) agreeable**. A solution that is agreeable means that it is acceptable or satisfactory to both parties. A hexachord is a musical term, food is something you eat, and easy is the opposite of hard.

","2. The correct answer is **(B) elective**. A policy that is elective means that it is optional or voluntary. A mandate is a command or an order, which is the opposite of elective. Optional is a synonym of elective, but it is repeated in the choices, which makes it an invalid answer. Advisory is a possible answer, but it implies that the policy is only a suggestion or a recommendation, not a choice. Therefore, elective is the best choice.

","3. The correct answer is **(A) child's book**. A child's book is a type of literature that is suitable for young readers and often features colorful illustrations and adventurous stories. A movie is a visual medium, not a book. An Australian outback, a bamboo grove, and a wilderness are all places, not books. Therefore, child's book is the best choice.

","7. The correct answer is **(A) plan ahead**. To plan ahead means to prepare or arrange things in advance. This is a crucial step to avoid problems when going somewhere. Find out where and know where to go are possible answers, but they are part of planning ahead, not separate steps. Highway is a type of road, not a step. Get going is a vague phrase that does not specify what to do. Therefore, plan ahead is the best choice.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","8. The correct answer is **(E) hallway**. A hallway is a passage or corridor in a building that connects rooms or spaces. Having a light source in the hallway can help you avoid tripping while moving through your home. Street and sky are outside the home, not inside. Flashlight is a type of light source, not a place. Books are objects, not light sources. Therefore, hallway is the best choice.

","10. The correct answer is (E) conformity.
