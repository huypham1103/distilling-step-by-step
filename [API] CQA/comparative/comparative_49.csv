This is because the words ""fresh"" and ""frozen"" are usually associated with food items, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, etc. The other choices do not match the context of the question. For example, (A) made a mistake implies that Sally did something wrong, which is not supported by the question. (B) control people suggests that Sally has some authority or influence over others, which is irrelevant to the question. (C) get things is too vague and does not specify what kind of things Sally got. (E) pay bills is also unrelated to the question, as it does not explain what Sally bought with her money.

This is because the word ""patient"" is directly related to the work of a dentist, who provides dental care and treatment to people. The other choices are not as relevant or specific to the question. For example, (A) office building is a general term that does not indicate why Sally had to work late. (B) town is also too broad and does not explain the reason for Sally's overtime.

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""Sally's boss told her to stop playing.  She was being very loud.  What was she playing?"" is **(B) organ**. This is because the word ""organ"" refers to a musical instrument that produces sound by using air to move through pipes or reeds. The organ is known for being loud and can be heard from a distance. The other choices are not as plausible or logical as the answer. For example, (A) telegram is a method of communication that uses electrical signals to transmit messages, which is not something that Sally can play with. (C) telegraph is similar to telegram, but uses a code of dots and dashes to send messages. (D) motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical motion, which is not a toy or a game.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question ""Sam and June bought loose corn because it was less expensive than what other variety?"" is **(C) packaged**. This is because the word ""packaged"" refers to corn that is wrapped or sealed in some material, such as plastic, paper, or foil. Packaged corn may cost more than loose corn because of the additional processing and packaging costs. The other choices are not as sensible or appropriate as the answer. For example, (A) footloose is an adjective that means free to go where one likes or do what one wants, which has nothing to do with corn. (B) bound is a verb that means to jump or leap, which is also irrelevant to corn. (D) cobbed is a noun that means the central part of a corn ear to which the kernels are attached, which is not a different variety of corn, but a part of it.

","6. The most likely answer to the question ""Sam didn't care about what company he kept on Christmas.  He just didn't want to be what?"" is **(B) alone**. This is because the word ""alone"" means having no one else present or being isolated or lonely. Sam may not have been picky about who he spent Christmas with, as long as he had some company and did not feel alone. The other choices are not as relevant or suitable as the answer. For example, (A) you is a pronoun that refers to the person or people being addressed, which is not what Sam wanted to avoid. (C) solitude is a noun that means the state or situation of being alone, which is similar to alone, but not as common or simple.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question ""Sam didn't expect to see something like that underground.  He used his hand to shade his eyes from what?"" is **(E) bright light**. This is because the word ""bright light"" refers to a source of illumination that is intense or dazzling. Sam may have been surprised by the presence of bright light underground, as it is usually dark or dim. He may have used his hand to shield his eyes from the glare or discomfort caused by the bright light. The other choices are not as reasonable or fitting as the answer. For example, (A) direct sunlight is a type of bright light that comes from the sun, which is unlikely to be found underground. (B) brightness is a noun that means the quality or state of being bright, which is not a source of light, but a property of it. (C) moon is a natural satellite that orbits the earth and reflects sunlight, which is also improbable to be seen underground. (D) full sunlight is another type of bright light that comes from the sun when it is not obscured by clouds or other objects, which is also implausible to be underground.

","8. The most likely answer to the question ""Sam didn't have to walk far to get lunch.  There was a deli on the ground floor of his what?"" is **(D) office building**. This is because the word ""office building"" refers to a large structure that contains offices or workplaces for various businesses or organizations. Sam may have worked in an office building that had a deli on the ground floor, which made it convenient for him to get lunch without walking far. The other choices are not as sensible or appropriate as the answer. For example, (A) town is a noun that means a built-up area with a name, defined boundaries, and local government, which is too large and vague to describe Sam's location. (B) shopping center is a noun that means a group of shops or stores built together, which is not necessarily where Sam worked or where the deli was. (C) strip mall is a noun that means a row of shops or stores along a road, which is also not a likely place for Sam to work or find a deli. (E) new york city is a proper noun that means the largest and most populous city in the United States, which is not a specific or relevant answer to the question.

Sam may have decided to end his trip and come back to his home if he did not enjoy the company of the people he met while traveling. The other choices are not as reasonable or fitting as the answer. For example, (B) airplane is a noun that means a powered flying vehicle with fixed wings and a weight greater than that of the air it displaces, which is not something that Sam can do, but a means of transportation that he can use. (C) learn from each other is a phrase that means to acquire knowledge or skills from one another, which is not a way to get away from people, but a way to interact with them. (D) go out is a phrase that means to leave one's home or place of stay for social or recreational purposes, which is not a way to avoid people, but a way to meet them. (E) make art is a phrase that means to create something that expresses one's imagination or feelings, which is not a way to escape from people, but a way to express oneself.

His bosses want him to do something with the new code, which is most likely to integrate it, which means to combine or merge it with his code to create a unified and coherent program. Detail is a specific or minor aspect of something, but it is not an action that someone can do with code. Loop is a structure in programming that allows repeated execution of a block of code, but it is not a goal that someone can have with code. Unexpected results are outcomes that are different from what was intended or expected, but they are not a desired effect of working with code.

Faith is a belief or trust in something or someone, especially without proof or evidence, but it is not a subject that can be studied or learned. Astronomy is a branch of science that studies the stars, planets, and other celestial objects, but it is not purer than science, because it relies on observations and measurements. Discovery is the act or process of finding or learning something new, but it is not a subject that can be taught or examined. Arts are the creative expression of human ideas and emotions, such as music, literature, painting, and so on, but they are not purer than science, because they are subjective and influenced by culture and history.
