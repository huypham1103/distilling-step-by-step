","1. The most likely answer to the question ""John saw a pair of disembodied lips floating towards him. He was hypnotized by their what?"" is **(D) motion**.

John may have been in a courtyard near a bullring or a festival where bulls are released into the streets. Lawn, tv room, versailles, and english countryhouse are all places that John could have been, but they are not very likely for him to watch bulls.

John, on the other hand, thought that Mary was still beautiful and did not care about her injury. Wrong, overcast, homely, and bad are all words that Mary could have believed, but they are not as strong or specific as misshapen.

John may have been taking a test or a quiz and picked A instead of B by mistake. He was relieved when he found out that A was actually the right answer and that he did not lose any points.

","3. The most likely answer to the question 'How is television different from radio?' is **(A) visual**. This is because television is a medium that uses both sound and images to convey information and entertainment, while radio only uses sound. The other options are not inherent differences between television and radio, but rather subjective opinions or judgments about them. For example, conformity, entertained, and laziness are not qualities that define television or radio, but rather how people may perceive or use them. Audio is not a difference, but a similarity, as both television and radio use sound.

This is because the question states that John emptied his closet racks into the box, which implies that he was storing his clothes in the box. The other options are not supported by the question, as they are either irrelevant or illogical. For example, hold secret, store food, store data, and hold things are not related to the context of the question, as they do not explain why John would empty his closet racks into a box.

This is because the question suggests that John was a student who was trying to test himself on his academic knowledge, but he was not good at it. Therefore, it makes sense that he would prefer to focus on completing his homework, which is a common task for students. The other options are not relevant to the question, as they are either too vague or too specific. For example, school grade, practice, ignore, and park are not things that John can complete, but rather goals, activities, actions, or places.
