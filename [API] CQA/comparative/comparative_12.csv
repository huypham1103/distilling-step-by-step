Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""In a war, the killing ends when every person does what?"" is **(E) dies**. This is because none of the other options are guaranteed to stop the killing in a war. Going to jail, punishment, and recognizing their true oppressors are possible outcomes of a war, but they do not necessarily end the violence.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question ""In ancient times they tried to chart each star, they spent a lot of time staring into the what?"" is **(D) heavens**. This is because the heavens is a synonym for the sky, where the stars are located.

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""In architecture, where are all buildings found?"" is **(C) all buildings**. This is because this is a tautology, meaning that it is true by definition. All buildings are found in all buildings, as they are the same thing. A table, inside, a restaurant, and a synagogue are not valid answers, as they are not places where all buildings are found. They are either too specific, too vague, or too unrelated to the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question ""In his head he was giving an eloquent pick up line, but in reality he was doing what over his words?"" is **(C) stumbling**. This is because stumbling over one's words means to speak hesitantly or awkwardly, which is the opposite of being eloquent. Speechless, muttering, and stuttering are not the best answers, as they do not imply a contrast between the person's intention and reality. Striking out is not a good answer, as it refers to the outcome of the pick up attempt, not the way the person spoke.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question ""In order to have food to eat, what do people typically do for it?"" is **(E) work for**. This is because most people need to earn money in order to buy food, which requires working for it. Growing food is not a typical way of obtaining food for most people, especially in urban areas. Purchasing food from webvan.com is not a valid answer, as it is a specific and outdated website that no longer exists. Browsing and shopping are not sufficient answers, as they do not explain how people get the money to buy food.

","7. The most likely answer to the question ""In the children's book the cat was a great knight, it had finished its quest and was returning to the castle to what?"" is **(E) live many years**. This is because this is a happy and satisfying ending for a children's book, as it implies that the cat was rewarded for its bravery and loyalty, and enjoyed a long and peaceful life. Seeing the king, meowing, and having fleas are not relevant to the question, as they do not relate to the cat's quest or its outcome. Sleeping all day is not a good answer, as it suggests that the cat was lazy or bored, which is not consistent with its character as a great knight.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question ""In the city the family didn't have a back yard, but now they did since they lived in a what?"" is **(B) suburb**. This is because suburbs are residential areas that typically have more space and greenery than cities, and often have back yards for houses. A farm, a property, and a neighborhood are not the best answers, as they are either too specific, too vague, or too broad to describe the contrast between the city and the new place. Yards is not a good answer, as it is not a type of place, but a feature of a place.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question ""In the morning you return to work, in the evening you?"" is **(E) leave work**. This is because this is the logical and common sequence of events for most people who work during the day.

","10. The most likely answer to the question ""In the movie a fragile man is causing accidents, his hope is to find a person opposite of him who is what?"" is **(B) unbreakable**. This is because this is the actual plot of the movie Unbreakable, directed by M. Night Shyamalan, where a man with a rare bone disorder tries to find someone who is immune to physical harm. Undestroyable, indestructible, and durable are not the best answers, as they are not the exact word used in the movie title or the dialogue.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) shotgun**. A shotgun is a type of firearm that fires multiple pellets or slugs at once, making it effective at close range. A pistol, an assault rifle, and a submachine gun are all single-shot weapons that have less spread and damage than a shotgun. A grenade launcher is also a weapon that fires explosive projectiles, but it is not rapid fire and can be dangerous at close range.
