Compare the options Sometimes when animals meet, what happens?, fight each other, procreate, sleep live lives and identify the most likely answer to the question 'listen to each other'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question is **fight each other**. This is because the sentence is vague and general, and it does not specify what kind of animals or what kind of meeting. Fight each other is a possible and common scenario when animals meet, especially if they are predators, prey, or competitors. Procreate, sleep, live lives, and listen to each other are more specific and less likely actions that depend on the type and situation of the animals.

","5. The most likely answer to the question is **demand justice**.

He wondered what the balloons where?, aloft, overhead, upwards upstairs and identify the most likely answer to the question 'above'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) above**. This is because the word 'above' means 'higher than something else, especially when not directly over it'. This fits the context of the sentence, where the balloons are higher than the person who is looking at them, but not necessarily directly over him. The other choices do not fit the context as well:

- (A) aloft means 'up in the air; overhead'. This implies that the balloons are flying or moving in the air, which is not stated in the sentence.
- (B) overhead means 'above the level of the head; in the sky'. This implies that the balloons are directly over the person's head, which is not stated in the sentence.
- (C) upwards means 'towards a higher place or position'. This implies that the balloons are moving or rising higher, which is not stated in the sentence.

","2. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) happiness**. This is because the word 'happiness' means 'the state of being happy'. This fits the context of the sentence, where the end of a marriage can also be a beginning of a new life that brings joy and satisfaction. The other choices do not fit the context as well:

- (A) grief means 'deep sorrow, especially caused by someone's death'. This implies that the end of a marriage is a tragic event that causes sadness and mourning, which is not necessarily true for all cases.
