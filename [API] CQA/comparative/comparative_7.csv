","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) tie shoelace**. This is because the sentence implies that he tripped because of his loose shoelace, and if he had thought to tie it before running, he might have escaped successfully.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) metro area**. This is because a metro area is a large and densely populated urban area that usually has more people and businesses than a rural area. Therefore, moving from a rural area to a metro area would likely increase the demand for dental services and make the office more crowded.

A medical building, a strip mall, or a city could be located in either a rural or an urban area, and an urban area is a broader term than a metro area.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) mess**. This is because the sentence describes a violent and bloody scene where the hunter had to stab the buck to death after missing his shot.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) table**. This is because the sentence suggests that he used the dictionary as a makeshift support for a wobbly leg of a piece of furniture. Therefore, it makes sense that the furniture was a table, which is commonly used for studying and has legs that can be wobbly. The other choices do not match the description of the sentence.

Therefore, it makes sense that he bought it online, meaning through the internet, which is a convenient and common way of purchasing electronic devices. The other choices do not explain where he bought the new system. A place, a computer store, or a computer science are vague and generic terms that do not specify a location. A human body is not a location at all, and it does not make sense to buy a computer system from a human body.

Therefore, it makes sense that the goal of socialising was to start friendships, meaning relationships based on mutual affection and support. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. Conflicts, jealousy, and getting out there are negative or redundant outcomes of socialising, not the purpose of it.

Therefore, it makes sense that he was a mormon, meaning a member of a religious group that historically practiced polygamy and still has some sects that do. The other choices do not explain his insatiable want for more. A presence, an overabundance, a stockpile, or a plentitude are all terms that refer to a large amount or quantity of something, not a type of person or a belief system.

This is because the sentence suggests that he had a medical condition that caused his hands to shake involuntarily, which is a symptom of diseases such as Parkinson's or essential tremor. Therefore, it makes sense that his wife saw his hands shaking when he was setting the cup on the table, which could indicate that he needed medical attention. The other choices do not match the description of the sentence. The table, the breaking, or the coaster are not things that can shake by themselves, and the skill is not something that can be seen visually.

","9. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) hole**. This is because the sentence implies that he was playing golf, which is a sport where the objective is to hit a ball with a club (such as an iron) into a hole on a course. Therefore, it makes sense that he had to get the ball in the hole, which is the basic rule of golf. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.

This is because the sentence implies that horses need a lot of nutrients to maintain their health and energy, especially after exercising. Therefore, it makes sense that they need to eat carrots, which are a type of vegetable that are rich in vitamins and minerals and are often fed to horses as a treat or a supplement.

This is because having a light, healthy lunch can provide you with enough energy and nutrients without making you feel too full or bloated.

This is because a music shop is a place that sells musical instruments and accessories, and it usually has strings for different types of basses, such as electric, acoustic, or upright. The other options are either too irrelevant (manual, orchestra, marching band) or too incomplete (bass guitar). A manual is a book or document that gives instructions or information, not a source of supplies.

This is because a class is a session of instruction or learning, and it is usually part of a school or educational institution. Going to class can help one gain more knowledge and avoid truancy, which is the act of skipping school without permission. The other options are either too broad (church, meeting, encyclopedia, university) or too unrelated (encyclopedia). A church is a place of worship, not a place of learning.

A railing can prevent people from falling off the deck, but it can also obstruct the view of the surroundings.

A stairwell, a house, a lawn, and a flight of stairs are not things that people can sit on. A flight of stairs is especially impractical because it is a set of steps that connect different levels of a building, not a place to relax.

6. The most likely answer to the question ""I really want a keyboard instrument, where should I go to try some out?"" is **(A) music store**. This is because a music store is a place where people can buy or rent musical instruments, including keyboard instruments. A music store may also have a variety of keyboard instruments to choose from, such as pianos, organs, synthesizers, etc. A band, an orchestra, an accompany singer, and a museum are not places where people can try out keyboard instruments. A museum is especially unlikely because it is a place where people can see historical or cultural artifacts, not play musical instruments.

7. The most likely answer to the question ""I want a dog that's easy to spot, which one should I get?"" is **(C) black**. This is because a black dog can stand out from the background, especially if the background is light-colored or has a lot of contrast. A black dog can also be easier to see at night or in dark places. A blind, a fun, an alive, and a playing dead dog are not characteristics that affect the visibility of a dog. A playing dead dog is especially irrelevant because it is a trick that some dogs can do, not a feature that makes them easy to spot.

Compare the options I want everyone to hear my voice, how should I speak?, being heard, loud, upwards beautiful and identify the most likely answer to the question 'sound'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question ""I want everyone to hear my voice, how should I speak?"" is **(B) loud**. This is because speaking loud can increase the volume and clarity of a voice, making it more audible and understandable for the listeners. Speaking loud can also convey confidence and enthusiasm. Being heard, upwards, beautiful, and sound are not ways of speaking that can ensure that everyone can hear a voice. Sound is especially vague because it is a general term for anything that can be heard, not a specific way of speaking.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question ""I want some original paintings to put on my wall, where should I go for inspiration?"" is **(C) labyrinth**. This is because a labyrinth is a complex and intricate structure that can stimulate the imagination and creativity of a person. A labyrinth can also offer a challenge and a sense of adventure that can inspire a person to create something new and unique. An art show, a classroom, a corner, and a paint store are not places that can provide much inspiration for original paintings. A paint store is especially unoriginal because it is a place where people can buy paint, not create paintings.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","10. The most likely answer to the question ""I want to create something new, what do I need?"" is **(C) plamodel**. This is because a plamodel is a plastic model kit that can be assembled and customized by a person. A plamodel can allow a person to create something new and different from the original design, using their own skills and preferences. A plamodel can also be a fun and rewarding hobby. Plasticulture, cookies, cups, and plastisol are not things that can help a person create something new. Plastisol is especially useless because it is a liquid plastic that can be used to make molds, not models."
"I want to make a fortune selling houses, what should I study?","['real estate', 'treasure chest', 'stock market', 'business', 'bank']","Questions: I want to make a fortune selling houses, what should I study?, Choices: (A) real estate, (B) treasure chest, (C) stock market, (D) business, (E) bank. Compare the options I want to make a fortune selling houses, what should I study?, real estate, treasure chest, stock market business and identify the most likely answer to the question 'bank'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""I want to make a fortune selling houses, what should I study?"" is **(A) real estate**. This is because real estate is the field that deals with buying, selling, and renting properties, such as houses, apartments, land, etc. Studying real estate can help you learn the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this industry, such as market analysis, negotiation, valuation, financing, etc. The other options are not directly related to selling houses. A treasure chest is a box that contains valuable items, such as gold, jewels, etc. The stock market is a place where shares of companies are traded. Business is a broad term that refers to any activity that involves producing or exchanging goods or services. A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits and lends money.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question ""I want to make new friends when I socialize at the party, what should I do?"" is **(C) mix**. This is because mixing means to interact with different people, especially in a friendly and informal way. Mixing can help you make new friends by showing your interest, personality, and communication skills. The other options are not as effective or appropriate for making new friends. Finding friends implies that you already have some friends in mind, which may limit your opportunities to meet new people. Singing is a form of entertainment, but it may not be suitable for every party or every person. Singing may also draw attention away from other people or make them feel uncomfortable. With people is not a complete answer, as it does not specify what you should do with people. Seeing people is a passive action, as it does not involve any interaction or communication.

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""I want to purchase both frozen food and party supplies in one stop, where would I go?"" is **(E) supermarket**. This is because a supermarket is a large store that sells a wide variety of products, including food, drinks, household items, etc. A supermarket is likely to have both frozen food and party supplies, such as ice cream, pizza, balloons, plates, cups, etc. The other options are not suitable for purchasing both frozen food and party supplies. A grocery store is a smaller store that mainly sells food and beverages, but it may not have a large selection of frozen food or party supplies. A refrigerator, a freezer, and a fridge are appliances that are used to store and preserve food, especially frozen food, but they are not places where you can buy food or party supplies"
