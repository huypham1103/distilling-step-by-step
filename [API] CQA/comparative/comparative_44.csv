Where might he live?, Choices: (A) in books, (B) radio station, (C) city, (D) tower, (E) medieval castle. Compare the options James lived in the top of a tall tower.  He could see clouds when he looked out his window.  Where might he live?, in books, radio station, city tower and identify the most likely answer to the question 'medieval castle'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) medieval castle**. This is because living in a tall tower that can see clouds is a common feature of medieval castles, which were built for defense and protection. The other options are less likely because:
    - (A) in books: This is not a specific location, but a fictional setting. James could live in a tower in books, but it does not answer the question of where he might live in reality.
    - (B) radio station: This is an unlikely place for someone to live, especially in a tall tower. Radio stations are usually located in urban areas or on hills, not in towers that can see clouds.
    - (C) city: This is a possible place for someone to live in a tall tower, but it is not very specific. There are many cities in the world, and not all of them have towers that can see clouds. Also, living in a city does not necessarily mean living in a tower.
    - (D) tower: This is a redundant option, since the question already states that James lived in a tower. It does not provide any additional information about where he might live.

","2. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) desk drawer**. This is because a desk drawer is a common place to store and find a pencil sharpener, especially if James is looking for one at home or at school. The other options are less likely because:
    - (A) cabinet: This is a possible place to find a pencil sharpener, but it is not very specific. There are many types of cabinets, and not all of them contain pencil sharpeners. Also, a cabinet might not be easily accessible or close to where James needs to use the pencil sharpener.
    - (B) library: This is an unlikely place to look for a pencil sharpener, unless James is at a library and needs to borrow one. Libraries are not places where people usually keep their own pencil sharpeners, and they might not have any available for public use.
    - (C) nightstand: This is an unlikely place to find a pencil sharpener, unless James keeps one there for some reason. A nightstand is usually used for storing personal items, such as books, glasses, or alarm clocks, not for school or work supplies.
    - (D) stationery store: This is an unlikely place to look for a pencil sharpener, unless James does not have one and needs to buy one. A stationery store is a place where people can purchase pencil sharpeners, not where they can find them easily or quickly.

Where might he have put it?, office, desktop, corner next to the bed and identify the most likely answer to the question 'at hotel'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) corner**. This is because a corner is an out of the way spot that can accommodate a floor lamp, without obstructing the traffic or the view of the room. The other options are less likely because:
    - (A) office: This is not a specific location, but a type of room. James could put his floor lamp in his office, but it does not answer the question of where he might have put it in his office. Also, an office might not be an out of the way spot, depending on how busy or crowded it is.
    - (B) desktop: This is an unlikely place to put a floor lamp, since it would take up a lot of space and interfere with the use of the desk. A desktop is usually used for placing a computer, a monitor, a keyboard, or other items that need to be close to the user, not for a large and tall lamp.
    - (D) next to the bed: This is a possible place to put a floor lamp, but it might not be an out of the way spot, depending on the size and layout of the bedroom. A floor lamp next to the bed might block the access to the bed, the nightstand, or the closet, or it might create too much light or heat for sleeping.
    - (E) at hotel: This is not a specific location, but a type of building. James could put his floor lamp at a hotel, but it does not answer the question of where he might have put it in the hotel.

It is reasonable to assume that he would leave the pile on the ground as well, unless he had a specific reason to move it elsewhere. The other options are less likely because they would require more effort or be impractical. For example, (A) forest is unlikely because James would have to transport the leaves to a different location, (B) roof is unlikely because James would have to climb up and down with the leaves, (C) garden is unlikely because James might not want to mix the leaves with his plants, and (D) tree is unlikely because James would have to attach the leaves to the branches somehow.

","7. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) talk to each other**. James thinks that people need to communicate more, which means he believes that people should share their thoughts and feelings more often. The most basic way to do that is to talk to each other, which is the use of spoken language to convey information and emotions. The other options are less likely because they do not match the definition of communication. For example, (A) believe in God is unlikely because it is a personal faith that does not necessarily involve communication with others, (B) argue is unlikely because it is a form of conflict that does not foster understanding or cooperation, (C) learn from each other is unlikely because it is a result of communication and not communication itself, and (D) kill each other is unlikely because it is an act of violence that ends communication.

James thought that the cost of buying the new screen outweighed the what, which means he compared the price and the value of the purchase. He thought that the benefit, which is the advantage or profit gained from something, was not worth the cost. The other options are less likely because they do not match the comparison. For example, (A) retail markup is unlikely because it is a part of the cost and not the value, (B) revenue is unlikely because it is the income generated by a business and not by a consumer, (C) for free is unlikely because it is the absence of cost and not a measure of value, and (D) income is unlikely because it is the money earned by a person and not the money spent by a person.
