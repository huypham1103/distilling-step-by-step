Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question 'The man put flooring in above his garage, what was he looking to make?' is **(A) loft**. A loft is a space at the top of a building under the roof, which can be used for living or storage.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question 'The man really liked the picture and wanted to look at it while checking emails, where did he paste it?' is **(A) desktop**. A desktop is the main screen of a computer, where icons and files are displayed. The man could paste the picture on his desktop as a wallpaper or a shortcut, so that he can see it whenever he uses his computer. The other options are not very logical, because a table, an art show, and a newspaper are physical objects that cannot be pasted with a picture. An art show is also a repeated option, which makes it less likely.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question 'The man sat down at the piano and played the A note for others to emulate, who was he with?' is **(B) symphony orchestra**. A symphony orchestra is a large group of musicians who play classical music with different instruments. The man could be the conductor or a pianist who plays the A note as a tuning reference for the rest of the orchestra. The other options are not very fitting, because a music room, a church, and a concert hall are places, not people. Athletes are also unlikely to be with a man who plays the piano.

","5. The most likely answer to the question 'The man set the cup on the table. It didn't matter. He didn't have anything to put it on, and he lacked the what to balance it?' is **(C) coaster**. A coaster is a small piece of material that is placed under a cup or a glass to protect the table from stains or scratches. The man did not have a coaster, and he lacked the skill to balance the cup on the table without spilling it. The other options are not very relevant, because tenacity, hands, and breaking are not things that can help balance a cup. Skill is also a repeated option, which makes it less probable.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question 'The man spent big money and time maintaining his lawn, it was part of keeping up with the Joneses where?' is **(B) suburbia**. Suburbia is a term that refers to the suburbs, which are residential areas outside the city center. The man lived in suburbia, where he felt the pressure to conform to the standards of his neighbors, who were nicknamed the Joneses. The other options are not very appropriate, because a front yard, a neighborhood, and a back yard are parts of a house, not a location. A golf course is also a place where people play golf, not where they live.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question 'The man suffered from beef allergies, what did he suffer from as a result of eating hamburger?' is **(A) death**. Death is a possible consequence of eating something that one is allergic to, especially if the reaction is severe and not treated in time. The other options are not very realistic, because gas, gain weight, and a meal are not symptoms of an allergic reaction. Satisfaction is also unlikely, because the man would not enjoy eating something that causes him pain and discomfort.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question 'The man took 3 hours every morning for grooming, what is the likely result with his job?' is **(A) tardiness**. Tardiness is the state of being late or behind schedule. The man would probably be tardy for his job, if he spent 3 hours every morning for grooming, which is an excessive amount of time. The other options are not very logical, because looking good, injury, vacation, and neatness are not directly related to the man's job performance or attendance.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question 'The man tried to learn how to play the game, but his injury meant that he would always do what?' is **(B) quit**. Quitting is a possible action that the man would take, if he could not play the game due to his injury.

Michigan is also a state, not an action.

","10. The most likely answer to the question 'The man tried to run, but he could not. He found that he could only move by doing what?' is **(E) walk slowly**. Walking slowly is a possible way that the man could move, if he could not run. The other options are not very feasible, because stand, go quickly, walking, and stand still are either too similar to running, too different from moving, or too general. Walking is also a repeated option, which makes it less likely."

Compare the options The man uses grooming before a job interview, what is he trying to portray?, looking good, beauty, tardiness handsomeness and identify the most likely answer to the question 'neatness'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""The man uses grooming before a job interview, what is he trying to portray?"" is **(E) neatness**. This is because grooming is the act of making oneself look tidy and presentable, which is a sign of neatness. Neatness is a desirable quality for a job applicant, as it shows that they are organized, professional, and respectful. The other choices are not as relevant or specific as neatness. Looking good, beauty, and handsomeness are all subjective and vague terms that do not necessarily imply neatness. Tardiness is the opposite of neatness, as it means being late or slow.

","2. The most likely answer to the question ""The man wanted a new cereal bowl, where should he buy one?"" is **(B) china shop**. This is because a china shop is a place that sells dishes, plates, bowls, and other items made of porcelain or ceramic. A cereal bowl is a type of bowl that is used to eat cereal, which is a common breakfast food. The other choices are not logical or appropriate places to buy a cereal bowl. Contain cereal, kitchen cabinet, cupboard, and cereal box are all places where one might find or store a cereal bowl, but not buy one.

This is because a furniture store is a place that sells various kinds of furniture, such as sofas, chairs, tables, beds, and ottomans. An ottoman is a type of furniture that is a low, upholstered seat or footstool that can also serve as a storage unit. The other choices are not suitable or common places to look for an ottoman. Basement, decoration, and parlor are all parts of a house or building, but not places that sell furniture. Couch outlet is a place that sells couches, which are different from ottomans.

","4. The most likely answer to the question ""The man wanted to have food ready for the work week, so he decided to what his meals ahead of time?"" is **(D) prepare**. This is because prepare is a verb that means to make or get something ready beforehand, especially food or a dish. The man wanted to have food ready for the work week, so he decided to prepare his meals ahead of time, meaning that he cooked or assembled his meals in advance and stored them in the fridge or freezer. The other choices are not relevant or sensible verbs to complete the sentence. Chew, eating, digest, and eat food are all actions that one does after the food is prepared, not before.

This is because sitting down is a verb phrase that means to be in a position in which one's weight is supported by one's buttocks rather than one's feet. The man wanted to take a bus, but all the chars were full of people doing what? means that the man wanted to board a bus, but all the seats were occupied by people who were sitting down.

","1. The most likely answer to the question 'bad breath' is (E) bad breath. This is because eating too much or too fast can cause bad breath due to the accumulation of food particles and bacteria in the mouth. The other choices are less likely because they are not directly related to the size or speed of the meals. For example, (A) gain weight is more related to the calorie intake and expenditure, (B) late for work is more related to the time management and schedule, (C) heartburn is more related to the acidity and spiciness of the food, and (D) felt weak is more related to the nutritional balance and blood sugar level."
