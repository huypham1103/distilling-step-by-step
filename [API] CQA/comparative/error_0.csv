Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) punishment**. This is because a teacher would usually give a punishment to a boy who is leaving line and disobeying the teacher's orders. The other options are less likely because they are either irrelevant or inappropriate. For example, (B) utter chaos is not something that the teacher would give, but rather a possible consequence of the boy's action. (C) trouble is too vague and could mean different things. (D) have to start over is not a common or logical response from the teacher. (E) high five is the opposite of what the teacher would do, as it would encourage the boy's misbehavior.

This is because a bride and groom are usually taking care of proposals for their marriage ceremony, which is the formal and legal union of two people. The other options are less likely because they are either unrelated or inaccurate. For example, (A) efficiency and (B) getting work done are not types of ceremonies, but rather qualities or goals.

","6. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) rainforest**. This is because a marmoset is a type of small monkey that is native to the rainforests of South America, where they live in the trees and feed on fruits, insects, and sap. The other options are less likely because they are either too broad or too specific. For example, (B) in wild and (C) national park are not places where marmosets are usually found, but rather categories of places that could include rainforests.

However, Venezuela is a country in South America where marmosets are found, so it is a possible place where a marmoset is. The other options are less likely because they are either too vague or too general. For example, (A) wilderness and (B) another place are not places where a marmoset is, but rather descriptions of places that could be anywhere.

This is because a monkey is out in the wild, meaning that it is living in its natural habitat, which for most species of monkeys is the tropical areas of the world, such as Africa, Asia, and South America. The other options are less likely because they are either unnatural or unlikely. For example, (B) school and (D) pet store are places where a monkey might be, but not out in the wild, as they are either domesticated or confined.

","9. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) french government**. This is because a monkey ran through La Defense with classified documents, meaning that it stole or obtained some secret or sensitive information from a source that would want to retrieve it. La Defense is a business district in Paris, France, so the most plausible source of the classified documents is the french government, which would also be the most likely to chase the monkey. The other options are less likely because they are either absurd or irrelevant. For example, (A) monkey and (D) madagascar are not entities that would chase the monkey, but rather the same or similar to the monkey.

This is because a natural starting fire from lighting raged on for the second week, meaning that it caused a lot of damage and danger to the environment and the people. The governor declared it the biggest what he had seen, meaning that he used a word to describe the magnitude and severity of the fire.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""A person and his friends had a wonderful weekend trip, what did they create together that will last a lifetime?"" is **(D) wonderful memories**. This is because memories are something that people can cherish for a long time, and they are often created by having fun and meaningful experiences with friends. The other options are less likely because:
    - (A) know truth: Knowing the truth is not something that is necessarily created by a weekend trip, and it may not last a lifetime if the truth changes or is forgotten.
    - (B) own house: Owning a house is not something that is typically done by a group of friends on a weekend trip, and it may not last a lifetime if the house is sold or destroyed.
    - (C) friendship bracelets: Friendship bracelets are a possible souvenir of a weekend trip, but they are not very durable and may not last a lifetime. They also do not capture the essence of the trip as well as memories do.
    - (E) intelligent children: Intelligent children are not something that is created by a weekend trip, unless the friends are romantically involved and conceive a child during the trip. However, this is a very unlikely scenario and does not apply to most cases of friendship.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question ""A person broke up with me, what do I have now?"" is **(D) broken heart**. This is because a broken heart is a common metaphor for the emotional pain and sadness that one feels after a breakup. The other options are less likely because:
    - (A) annoyance: Annoyance is a mild form of anger or irritation, and it may not accurately describe the intensity of the feelings that one has after a breakup. Annoyance is also not something that one has, but rather something that one feels.
    - (B) hospitalized: Hospitalized means that one is admitted to a hospital for medical treatment, and it is not a direct consequence of a breakup. One may be hospitalized for other reasons, such as physical injuries or illnesses, but not necessarily because of a breakup.
    - (C) schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects how one thinks, feels, and behaves. It is not caused by a breakup, and it is not something that one has, but rather something that one suffers from.
    - (E) stress: Stress is a state of mental or emotional strain or tension that results from adverse or demanding circumstances.

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""A person doesn't have pants that fit, what should he do?"" is **(C) buy clothes**. This is because buying clothes is a reasonable and practical solution to the problem of not having pants that fit. The other options are less likely because:
    - (A) buy a monkey: Buying a monkey is an irrelevant and absurd action that has nothing to do with the problem of not having pants that fit. It is also a costly and irresponsible decision that may create more problems than it solves.
    - (B) let himself go: Letting himself go means to stop caring about one's appearance or health, and it is not a desirable or advisable thing to do. It may also worsen the problem of not having pants that fit, as one may gain or lose weight and need different sizes of pants.
    - (D) bank money: Banking money means to save or deposit money in a bank, and it is not a direct or immediate solution to the problem of not having pants that fit. It may be a good idea to save money for future purchases, but it does not address the current need for pants that fit.
    - (E) catch cold: Catching a cold means to become infected with a virus that causes symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, and fever.

","1. The most likely answer to the question ""A person is putting a sofabed in a house for a guest, where are they likely to place it?"" is **(E) spare room**. This is because a spare room is usually a room that is not used regularly and can be converted into a guest room when needed. A sofabed is a sofa that can be unfolded into a bed, which is convenient for guests who need a place to sleep.

","2. The most likely answer to the question ""A person notices popcorn, cotton candy on the grass, where is he likely?"" is **(B) fairgrounds**. This is because fairgrounds are places where fairs or carnivals are held, and they usually have stalls that sell popcorn and cotton candy. These snacks are often eaten by people who attend the fairs, and some of them may drop them on the grass. The other options are less likely because they are either irrelevant (soccer game and movie theatre do not have grass), unlikely (countryside is not a place where popcorn and cotton candy are commonly sold or eaten), or incorrect (state park is not a specific location, but a general term for a park that is operated by a state government).

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question ""A person regrets their actions, what are they likely to have?"" is **(B) bad feelings**. This is because bad feelings are negative emotions that a person may experience when they realize that they have done something wrong or harmful. A person who regrets their actions may feel guilty, ashamed, remorseful, or sad. The other options are less likely because they are either unrelated (deception is the act of lying or misleading someone, not a feeling), extreme (live in poverty and schizophrenia are not consequences of regret, but rather social and mental conditions that may affect a person's life), or irrelevant (indigestion is a physical discomfort that is caused by eating too much or too fast, not by regret).

","4. The most likely answer to the question ""A politician makes countless empty promises during a campaign, but the only real goal is to what?"" is **(C) win elections**. This is because winning elections is the main objective of most politicians, especially those who are dishonest or corrupt. They may make false or unrealistic promises to the voters in order to gain their support and trust, but they do not intend to fulfill them once they are in office. The other options are less likely because they are either too vague (power and influence are abstract concepts that do not specify what the politician wants to do with them), redundant (re elected is the same as win elections), or inaccurate (bribe is the act of giving or receiving money or favors in exchange for something, not a goal).

This is because a christmas tree is a traditional symbol of Christmas, which is a holiday that is celebrated in December by many people around the world. A christmas tree is usually decorated with lights, ornaments, and a star or an angel on top. It can bring joy and festive spirit to a poor family who may not have much to celebrate. The other options are less likely because they are either too basic (food is a necessity, not a gift), too expensive (specialty store and department store are places that sell high-end or luxury items that a poor family may not be able to afford), or too small (christmas stocking is a sock that is hung on a fireplace or a wall and filled with small gifts or candies, but it is not a decoration by itself).

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question ""A quarter of it was twenty five pounds, so the whole was what?"" is **(B) hundredweight**. This is because a hundredweight is a unit of weight that is equal to 100 pounds in the US system or 112 pounds in the UK system. If a quarter of it was 25 pounds, then the whole was 100 pounds in the US system or 112 pounds in the UK system.

","7. The most likely answer to the question ""A regular everyday human would just call it a meeting, but people like cardinals might call it a what?"" is **(A) conclave**. This is because a conclave is a special meeting of the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church that is held to elect a new pope. A regular everyday human would not use this term, but people like cardinals might call it a conclave. The other options are less likely because they are either unrelated (sanctuary is a place of refuge or protection, not a meeting), incorrect (homes and mortuary are not places where meetings are held, but where people live or are buried), or inappropriate (stadium is a large venue where sports or concerts are held, not a meeting).

","8. The most likely answer to the question ""A relationship that was once filled with the heat of passion but now has someone showing no emotion towards the other, the person has now demonstrated what towards the other?"" is **(D) coldness**. This is because coldness is the state or quality of being cold, which can mean having a low temperature or showing a lack of warmth, affection, or emotion. A person who shows no emotion towards their partner may be described as cold or having a cold heart. This is the opposite of the heat of passion, which implies intense or fiery feelings of love or desire. The other options are less likely because they are either too mild (indifference and coolness are not as strong as coldness in expressing a lack of emotion), irrelevant (air conditioning is a system that regulates the temperature and humidity of a room or a vehicle, not a feeling), or confusing (cooling is a process of becoming cooler, not a state of being cold).

","100 pounds in the US system or 112 pounds in the UK system. If a quarter of it was 25 pounds, then the whole was 100 pounds in the US system or 112 pounds in the UK system. The other options are less likely because they are either irrelevant (school year and century are units of time, not weight), incorrect (upper is not a unit of anything, but a part of a shoe or a garment), or ambiguous (hour is a unit of time, but it can also refer to a rate of pay or a distance traveled).

7. The most likely answer to the question ""A regular everyday human would just call it a meeting, but people like cardinals might call it a what?"" is **(A) conclave**. This is because a conclave is a special meeting of the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church that is held to elect a new pope. A regular everyday human would not use this term, but people like cardinals might call it a conclave. The other options are less likely because they are either unrelated (sanctuary is a place of refuge or protection, not a meeting), incorrect (homes and mortuary are not places where meetings are held, but where people live or are buried), or inappropriate (stadium is a large venue where sports or concerts are held, not a meeting).

8. The most likely answer to the question ""A relationship that was once filled with the heat of passion but now has someone showing no emotion towards the other, the person has now demonstrated what towards the other?"" is **(D) coldness**. This is because coldness is the state or quality of being cold, which can mean having a low temperature or showing a lack of warmth, affection, or emotion. A person who shows no emotion towards their partner may be described as cold or having a cold heart. This is the opposite of the heat of passion, which implies intense or fiery feelings of love or desire. The other options are less likely because they are either too mild (indifference and coolness are not as strong as coldness in expressing a lack of emotion), irrelevant (air conditioning is a system that regulates the temperature and humidity of a room or a vehicle, not a feeling), or confusing (cooling is a process of becoming cooler, not a state of being cold).

9. The most likely answer to the question ""A rock hit the windshield while he was on the highway, it caused him to nearly crash his what?"" is **(C) automobile**. This is because an automobile is a road vehicle that has four wheels and an engine and is used for transporting people or goods. A rock hitting the windshield of an automobile can cause damage or obstruct the driver's vision, which can lead to a crash. The other options are less likely because they are either impossible (motorboat and airplane are not vehicles that can be driven on a highway), irrelevant (barrier is an obstacle that prevents or restricts movement, not a vehicle), or redundant (motor vehicle is a general term that includes automobiles, but also other types of vehicles such as motorcycles or buses).

10. The most likely answer to the question ""A sailor has to do a lot of prep work before the ship can leave, but what is the first step he must take?"" is **(E) board ship**. This is because boarding a ship is the act of getting on or entering a ship, which is necessary for a sailor to do before he can perform any other tasks. A sailor cannot do any prep work on a ship if he is not on it. The other options are less likely because they are either premature (leave dock is the last step, not the first, that a ship takes before sailing), irrelevant (coming home is not a step that a sailor takes before leaving, but after returning), or incorrect (row boat and sail boat are types of boats, not steps that a sailor takes)."

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""A student puked in the cafeteria, the janitor retrieved his bucket of sawdust from the what?"" is **(A) utility closet**. This is because a utility closet is a small room or cabinet that contains cleaning supplies and equipment, such as a bucket of sawdust. A well, a garden shed, a pantry, and a cupboard are not likely places to store a bucket of sawdust in a school setting.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question ""A student takes an unpaid membership, why on Earth would he do that?"" is **(A) gain experience**. This is because an unpaid membership is usually a form of volunteering or interning that allows a student to learn new skills, network with professionals, and enhance their resume. Taking notes, listening carefully, and studying book are not reasons to take an unpaid membership, but rather activities that a student might do during their membership. Capitalist exploitation is a negative and cynical way of viewing an unpaid membership, and not a likely answer.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question ""A student want to recall information from class later, what is he doing?"" is **(E) taking notes**. This is because taking notes is a proven strategy to help students remember and review the material that was taught in class. Gaining experience, studying book, paying attention, and listening carefully are also beneficial for learning, but they are not as specific or effective as taking notes for recalling information later.

","4. The most likely answer to the question ""A student wants to hear what the professor is saying, what does he do?"" is **(C) listen carefully**. This is because listening carefully is the most direct and obvious way to hear what the professor is saying. Gaining experience, taking notes, completing test, and focusing are also important for academic success, but they are not as relevant or necessary as listening carefully for hearing the professor.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question ""After eating very quickly and jumping up and down, what is likely to occur?"" is **(C) vomiting**. This is because eating very quickly and jumping up and down can cause nausea, indigestion, and stomach upset, which can lead to vomiting. Getting warm, hiccups, lot of noise, and exhaustion are also possible outcomes, but they are not as likely or severe as vomiting.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question ""After exercising for 3 hours straight, what did the girl experience?"" is **(E) pain**. This is because exercising for 3 hours straight is a very intense and prolonged physical activity, which can cause muscle damage, inflammation, and soreness, resulting in pain. Exhaustion, muscle growth, tiredness, and sore muscles are also common effects of exercising, but they are not as strong or specific as pain.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question ""After exiting a ring road and headed to a group of homes, where are you going?"" is **(E) european city**. This is because a ring road is a circular road that surrounds a city or town, and is typically found in Europe.

","9. The most likely answer to the question ""After four long years he would no longer be a student, what had he been able to do?"" is **(E) finish college**. This is because four years is the typical duration of a college degree program, and after completing it, a person would no longer be a student. Solving equation, beginning teaching, studying book, and graduating are also possible achievements or activities that a person might do after four years, but they are not as definitive or conclusive as finishing college.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question 'After taking measurements with an armband, the doctor recommended medicine for what purpose?' is **lower blood pressure**. This is because an armband is a device that measures blood pressure, which is the force of blood against the walls of the arteries.

","4.0 gpa, how did I feel?' is **success**. This is because a 4.0 gpa is the highest possible grade point average, which indicates excellent academic performance. Getting a 4.0 gpa after taking final exams would make most students feel proud, happy, and accomplished. The other choices are not appropriate feelings for this situation. Graduation is an event, not a feeling. Headaches are a physical symptom, not a feeling. Fail again and failure are negative outcomes, not feelings.

3. The most likely answer to the question 'After the sex she had spent the night at his house, he got up early to make and what?' is **coffee**. This is because coffee is a common beverage that people drink in the morning to wake up and energize themselves. It is also a polite gesture to offer coffee to someone who stayed over at your house. The other choices are not very likely or relevant for this situation. Love another implies cheating or infidelity, which is not a nice thing to do. Smoke is a habit that some people have, but it is not very healthy or considerate to do in someone else's house. Eat breakfast is a possible answer, but it is less specific than coffee. Wait for is incomplete and vague, as it does not specify what or who he is waiting for.

4. The most likely answer to the question 'After the windstorm it needed replacing, he decided to get a heavier tile what?' is **roof**. This is because a roof is a part of a house that is exposed to the weather and can be damaged by strong winds. A roof is also made of tiles, which are pieces of material that cover the roof. Heavier tiles may be more resistant to wind damage and provide better insulation. The other choices are not very logical or relevant for this situation. Home is too broad and vague, as it does not specify what part of the home needed replacing. Fabric is not a suitable material for a roof, as it is not durable or waterproof. Floor is not affected by windstorms, as it is inside the house. Computer game is not related to the windstorm or the tile at all.

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""If people have trouble finding enough resources to fulfill their calorie requirements, what might they have to do?"" is **(B) compete with each other**. This is because resources are often scarce or unevenly distributed, and people may have to fight or compete for access to them. Competition can be violent or peaceful, depending on the situation and the people involved. The other options are not as likely or logical as competing with each other. For example, feeling lonely is not a direct result of having trouble finding enough resources, but rather a possible emotional state that may affect one's well-being.

Discomfort can make it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep, and may require some adjustments or remedies to alleviate it.

This is because boats can transport large amounts of cargo across long distances at relatively low costs, compared to other modes of transportation. Boats are also not affected by traffic or road conditions, which can cause delays or increase expenses. The other choices are not as suitable or economical for moving cargo.
