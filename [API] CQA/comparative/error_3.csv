Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""The goalie felt blood on his face after blocking a ball, where was he?"" is **(D) soccer game**.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""The man was hungry and going fishing, what was he planning to do with the fish?"" is **(E) killing**. This is because the man was hungry and needed to kill the fish in order to eat them. The other options are not relevant to his hunger or his fishing activity. Relaxation, talking, having fun, and boredom are possible reasons for fishing, but they are not directly related to what he was planning to do with the fish.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question ""The man was in a rut of selfish thoughts and decided to commit suicide, he didn't think of the what it would cause others?"" is **(C) pain**. This is because committing suicide would cause pain and grief to the people who cared about him, such as his family and friends. The other options are not appropriate to describe the impact of his decision on others. Would die, dying, and end life are synonyms for suicide, but they do not answer the question. Jubilation is the opposite of what it would cause others, as it means joy and happiness.

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""The man was playfully wrestling with a woman he was enamored with, what was the physiological result?"" is **(E) erections**.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question ""The man was riding bike very quickly, clearly he had to what?"" is **(B) get somewhere**. This is because riding bike very quickly implies that he was in a hurry and had a destination or a goal to reach. The other options are not logical or consistent with his behavior. Run away, falling down, and accident are negative consequences of riding bike very quickly, but they are not what he had to do. Pleasure is a positive emotion that he might feel from riding bike very quickly, but it is not a necessity or a reason for his action.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question ""The mat was non slip, it was also picked to match the colors of everything else in the what?"" is **(E) living room**. This is because a non slip mat is a common item that people use in their living rooms to prevent slipping on the floor and to decorate their space. The other options are not suitable places for a non slip mat that matches the colors of everything else. Gym, school, and bathroom are public or shared places that do not require a matching mat. House is too broad and vague to specify where the mat is located.

","6. The most likely answer to the question ""The measurement was important and they had to make a, what kind of increase, to get it just right?"" is **(B) slight**. This is because a slight increase means a small or minor change that could make a difference in the accuracy or precision of the measurement.

","7. The most likely answer to the question ""The meat was ready to cook, it needed to go in where for at least four hours?"" is **(A) oven**. This is because an oven is a common appliance that people use to cook meat for a long time at a high temperature. The other options are not feasible or reasonable places to put the meat for four hours. Ham sandwich, a pot, and frying pan are either already cooked, too small, or too hot to hold the meat for four hours. Butcher shop is where people buy the meat, not where they cook it.

This is because a cell is a basic unit of life that has a membrane that surrounds and protects it from the external environment. The other options are not correct or relevant to what the membrane protected. Protect is a verb, not a noun, and it does not answer the question. Filtration is a process, not a thing, and it is not related to the membrane. Animal is too general and vague to specify what the membrane protected.

","9. The most likely answer to the question ""The men talked at length and found they were agreeing with a lot of things, how would they describe their feeling toward one another?"" is **(E) like**. This is because liking someone is a common and natural feeling that people have when they talk to someone who shares their views and opinions.

","10. The most likely answer to the question ""The monkey didn't touch the ground.  He jumped around, laughed, threw things, and had all sorts of fun, but he never left something. What did he never leave?"" is **(E) treetops**. This is because treetops are the highest part of the trees where monkeys often live and play. The other options are not consistent or logical with what the monkey never left. Branches are part of the trees, but they are not the same as treetops. Brazil is a country, not a place where the monkey stayed. Playful mood is an emotion, not a location. Rain forest is a biome, not a specific area where the monkey never left."

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""The monkey realized he was surrounded by water, where was the monkey?"" is **(A) madagascar**. This is because Madagascar is an island country that is surrounded by water.

The plants were the same, the trees were the same, but it still wasn't right  Where did the monkey come from?"" is **(E) brazil**.
