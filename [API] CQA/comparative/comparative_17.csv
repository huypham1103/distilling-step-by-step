Were cold and you're cold are past tense and second person, respectively, while the sentence is in present tense and third person.

","9. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) race track**. This is because a race track is a place where people often go to gamble on horse races, and wearing an extravagant hat is a common fashion choice for such events. The other options are less likely because they are not places where gambling is as prevalent or appropriate as a race track. Casino is a place where gambling is also common, but it does not require wearing a hat.

This is because washing hands over one thousand times a day could cause the skin to lose its natural moisture and become dry and cracked. The other options are less likely because they are not directly related to washing hands or are not specific enough. Health is a general term that does not indicate what kind of health problem she had. Become wet is a temporary and obvious result of washing hands, not a lasting consequence. Skin irritation is a possible effect of washing hands too much, but it is not as precise as dry skin. Medium is a vague and irrelevant word that does not describe anything about her condition."

","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) leave work**. This option makes the most sense in the context of the sentence, as it implies that she had a busy schedule at work and had to run errands and pick up the kids right after she finished her work. The other options are either irrelevant or illogical. For example, (A) make time for does not fit the sentence structure, (B) take money does not explain why she had a busy schedule, (C) go outdoors is too vague and does not indicate what she was doing before, and (E) field is a noun that does not match the verb did.

This option is the most appropriate compliment for someone who has a knack for entertaining, as it suggests that she has a natural ability or skill for it. The other options are either too general or not related to entertaining. For example, (A) fun is an adjective that does not fit the sentence structure, (C) learn about is a verb phrase that does not match the verb had, (D) intelligence is a noun that does not necessarily imply entertaining, and (E) recognize is a verb that does not make sense in the sentence.
