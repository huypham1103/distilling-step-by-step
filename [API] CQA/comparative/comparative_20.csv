","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) sparse**. This means that the buffalo were hunted to the point that their numbers were very few and scattered. This makes sense in the context of the sentence, as it contrasts with the words big and thick. The other options do not fit well with the sentence. Thin and stomach are adjectives that describe physical attributes, not numbers. Clear is an adjective that describes transparency, not quantity. Thickskin is a noun that means a person who is not easily offended, not a word that describes the number of buffalo.

","2. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) large building**. This means that the building was big enough to accommodate many people, but it was not used for any public or educational purpose. This matches the description of the building in the sentence, as it was owned by a billionaire and used only for his personal entertainment. The other options do not fit well with the sentence.

","3. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) tradesmen**. This means that the people who came in to the picture were skilled workers who specialized in flooring. This makes sense in the context of the sentence, as it explains who did the work of installing the floor. The other options do not fit well with the sentence. Builders and architect are people who are involved in the construction of the building, not the flooring. Target and tornado are nouns that have nothing to do with flooring or building.

Small and in a hole are adjectives that describe the opposite of a place that needs buildings that can hold a lot of people. University is a type of institution that may have large buildings, but it is not a place where buildings are built. Town is a noun that describes a smaller and less crowded place than a large city.

","1. The most likely answer to the question 'The business meeting was more casual and not standard protocol, what was it like?' is **(A) informal**. This is because informal means relaxed and not following strict rules or conventions, which matches the description of the meeting. The other options are not as suitable because:
    - (B) nonstandard means not conforming to a norm or standard, which is too vague and does not imply casualness.
    - (C) colloquial means using informal or conversational language, which is more about the way of speaking than the way of conducting a meeting.
