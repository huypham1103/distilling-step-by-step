You may shiver or experience shrinkage as a result of being cold, but not directly from being wet.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question 'If you eat beans when eating dinner, what noise are you likely to make?' is **(D) flatulence**. This is because beans contain a type of carbohydrate called oligosaccharides, which are not easily digested by the human body. They pass through the small intestine and reach the large intestine, where they are fermented by bacteria, producing gas. This gas can cause bloating, discomfort, and flatulence, which is the sound of gas escaping from the anus. The other options are either irrelevant or incorrect.

","4. The most likely answer to the question 'If you found yourself explaining what a rook was named a rook, it might be because a child is calling it a what?' is **(E) castle**. This is because a rook is a chess piece that looks like a tower or a castle, and it can move horizontally or vertically on the board. A child who is not familiar with chess may call it a castle, because that is what it resembles. The other options are either nonsensical or unrelated.

This is because an undercover shopper is someone who is hired by a company or an agency to evaluate the quality of products, services, or customer experience in a store or a business. You would buy products as a normal customer, then write a review or fill a survey about your experience. You would get money as a payment or a reimbursement for your work.

","8. The most likely answer to the question 'If you have a lot of money after cashing in your chips at a casino, what would the casino owner feel towards you?' is **(B) resentment**. This is because resentment is a feeling of anger or bitterness towards someone who has done something unfair, wrong, or harmful. If you have a lot of money after cashing in your chips at a casino, it means that you have won a lot of money from gambling, which is a loss for the casino owner. The casino owner may feel resentment towards you, because you have taken away their profit or advantage. The other options are either implausible or irrelevant. You would not cause betrayal, get money, or revenge to the casino owner by cashing in your chips. And the casino owner would not leave the casino because of you, unless they are bankrupt or scared.

For example, delay is a postponement or interruption that could prevent you from renewing your card, buy the card is a purchase that you do not need to do if you already have a card, sitting down is an action that has nothing to do with the library, and not working is a state that you want to avoid for your card.

Letter is a symbol or character that is used in typing, but it has nothing to do with taking a break. Thirst is a feeling of needing to drink water, but it is not caused by typing. Printed word is a term that refers to words that are printed on paper or other materials, but it is not relevant to typing.

","9. The most likely answer to the question 'If you're using a trash can in the downtown district of a city, where may you be?' is **(E) park**. This is because a park is a public place that is usually located in the downtown district of a city and has trash cans for people to dispose of their waste. The other options are less likely because they are either not in the downtown district or do not have trash cans. For example, water cooler is a device that provides cold water, but it is usually found in offices or homes, not in the downtown district. Office is a place where people work, but it is not a public place and does not have trash cans for visitors.

","10. The most likely answer to the question 'If you're very religious and end up stopping being married to your spouse, what may you think of your decision?' is **(E) wrong**. This is because wrong is a moral or ethical judgment that implies that something is bad or unacceptable, and some religions consider divorce to be a sin or a violation of God's will. The other options are less likely because they are either emotions or feelings that do not reflect the religious aspect of the question. For example, depression and grief are feelings of sadness or loss that could affect anyone who ends a marriage, regardless of their religion. Happy and relief are feelings of joy or satisfaction that could also affect anyone who ends a marriage, especially if they were unhappy or abused in their relationship."
