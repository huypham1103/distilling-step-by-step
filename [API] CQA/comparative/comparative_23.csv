","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) cheers**. This is because when a team scores a point in a basketball game, the crowd usually cheers to show their support and excitement. The other options are not very relevant or logical. Sweating is a physical reaction to heat or exertion, not a response to a score.

The best way to do that is to cool off by moving to a shady or air-conditioned place, removing excess clothing, applying cold water or ice packs, and drinking fluids. The other options are not very helpful or realistic. Build a snowman is a fun activity that involves making a figure out of snow, but it is not possible or practical in hot weather.

This is because the phrase ""passing sentence"" means to announce the punishment for a crime, and the word ""condemned"" implies that the punishment is severe and irreversible. The other options are either too vague or inappropriate.

","5. The most likely answer to the question ""The jury deliberated for hours, the choice of passing sentence required them to make a what?"" is **(E) judgement**. This is because a judgement is a decision or opinion that is formed after careful consideration of the facts and arguments. The other options are either inaccurate or unrelated. For example, (A) court house is a building where trials are held, not a choice that the jury makes, (B) go to jail and (C) death are possible sentences, but they are not choices that the jury makes, but that the judge announces, (D) appeals are requests for a higher court to review the verdict, not choices that the jury makes.

","7. The most likely answer to the question ""The keyboard instrument took great talent, but he just looked goofy playing it onstage next to the drums and guitar as part of the what?"" is **(C) band**. This is because a band is a group of musicians who play different instruments together, and it is common to see drums and guitar in a band. The other options are either nonsensical or mismatched.

","9. The most likely answer to the question ""The kid wanted to go outside and play, what was he sick of doing?"" is **(D) doing nothing**. This is because doing nothing means to be idle or bored, and a kid who wants to go outside and play is likely to be tired of being inactive or uninterested. The other options are either irrelevant or contradictory. For example, (A) serious means to be solemn or earnest, which is not something that a kid usually does, (B) hatred means to have intense dislike or hostility, which is not something that a kid should feel, (C) longplay means to play a record or a video game for a long time, which is something that a kid may enjoy, and (E) musical means to be related to music or a musical performance, which is something that a kid may like or dislike, but not be sick of.

","10. The most likely answer to the question ""The kids ate crackers as the played on the floor, afterwards their mother had to vacuum up all the what?"" is **(E) rug**. This is because a rug is a piece of fabric that covers part of the floor, and it is likely to get dirty or messy when kids eat crackers on it. The other options are either incorrect or unnecessary. For example, (A) floor is too broad and does not specify what part of the floor needs to be vacuumed, (B) box of crackers is something that the kids may have used to get the crackers, but not something that needs to be vacuumed, (C) carpet is similar to rug, but it usually covers the entire floor, not just a part of it, and (D) table is a piece of furniture that is not on the floor, and does not need to be vacuumed."

","1. The most likely answer to the question 'The kids had been having fun all day, there was now a what?' is **(B) need for rest**. This is because the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.

This is because the other options do not describe the action that the kitten would need to do with its claws. Contract, compress, hold, and shorten are all verbs that could apply to other objects or body parts, but they do not capture the mechanism of the kitten's claws.

","2. The most likely answer to the question ""The living room is a common area for the family, it really makes it feel like a what?"" is **(E) home**. This is because a home is a place where people feel comfortable, safe, and connected with their family.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question ""The lizard frightened the hiker, its movements made what rustle?"" is **(E) bushes**. This is because bushes are plants that grow close to the ground and have many branches and leaves that can make a rustling sound when something moves through them. A garden, a tree, a book, or a rock are not likely to make a rustling sound when a lizard moves on or near them. Therefore, bushes are the most plausible option for what the lizard's movements made rustle.

","4. The most likely answer to the question ""The lizard lived at the base of the ancient longest wall, what country did it likely live in?"" is **(D) China**. This is because China is the country that has the ancient longest wall, which is the Great Wall of China. The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that stretches for over 21,000 kilometers along the northern border of China. A forest, a desert, a tropic, or a garden are not countries, but geographical or ecological features that can be found in many countries. Therefore, China is the most reasonable answer to the question.

","5. The most likely answer to the question ""The lizard looked longingly out of its cage, what was the lizard's status?"" is **(A) captivity**. This is because captivity means being confined or imprisoned in a place that is not natural or suitable for an animal. A lizard that is kept in a cage is in captivity, and may look longingly out of its cage because it wants to escape or return to its natural habitat. Costa Rica, a river, an encyclopedia, or a garden are not statuses, but locations or objects that may or may not be related to the lizard. Therefore, captivity is the most appropriate answer to the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question ""The lizard startled the vacationer, he then joked it was one thing that hadn't disappeared in the mysterious triangle where?"" is **(D) Bermuda**. This is because Bermuda is the name of an island and a territory that is part of the Bermuda Triangle, a region in the Atlantic Ocean where many ships and planes have allegedly vanished without a trace. The vacationer may have joked that the lizard was one thing that hadn't disappeared in the mysterious triangle because it was still visible and alive. South America, South Carolina, Utah, or New Mexico are not part of the Bermuda Triangle, and are not known for having mysterious disappearances. Therefore, Bermuda is the most likely answer to the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question ""The lizard was at the zoo, the protester stole it and returned it to the what?"" is **(A) wild**. This is because the wild is the natural environment where animals live freely and independently, without human intervention or control. A protester who stole a lizard from the zoo may have done so because they wanted to return it to the wild, where they believed it belonged. A glass cage, a restaurant, a garden, or the Galapagos Archipelago are not places where a protester would likely return a stolen lizard, as they are either unnatural, inappropriate, or too far away. Therefore, the wild is the most sensible answer to the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question ""The lizard was certainly out of its element in the bustling capital of San Jose, where was the lizard?"" is **(A) Costa Rica**. This is because Costa Rica is the name of the country where San Jose is the capital city. San Jose is a large and busy urban center, where a lizard would not be expected to be found or feel comfortable. Captivity, an encyclopedia, New Mexico, or Imagination Land are not places where the lizard was, as they are either abstract concepts, unrelated locations, or fictional realms. Therefore, Costa Rica is the most accurate answer to the question.

Compare the options The local business needed an advertisement, they bought one on the side of what public transport?, la ville, bus, store magazine and identify the most likely answer to the question 'taxi cab'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question ""The local business needed an advertisement, they bought one on the side of what public transport?"" is **(B) bus**. This is because a bus is a common and popular form of public transport that travels on roads and carries many passengers. A local business may have bought an advertisement on the side of a bus to reach a large and diverse audience of potential customers. La ville, a store, or a magazine are not forms of public transport, but rather a French word for city, a place where goods are sold, or a printed publication. A taxi cab is a form of public transport, but it is not as widely used or visible as a bus. Therefore, a bus is the most reasonable answer to the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","10. The most likely answer to the question ""The local environmentalist and philanthropist passed away, he was memorialized on a bench located where?"" is **(D) state park**. This is because a state park is a public area that is preserved and protected for its natural beauty, wildlife, and recreational opportunities. A local environmentalist and philanthropist may have been memorialized on a bench located in a state park because they cared about the environment and supported the conservation of nature. A rest area, a garden, a bus depot, or a bank are not places where a bench memorializing an environmentalist and philanthropist would likely be located, as they are either unrelated, private, or commercial. Therefore, a state park is the most fitting answer to the question."

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) city**. The local place could be a small town or a rural area that does not have a lot of variety in terms of products or services.
