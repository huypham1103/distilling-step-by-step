This is because downtown, also known as the city center, is the commercial and cultural hub of a city, where many shops, restaurants, offices, and entertainment venues are located.

Backyard, Montana, and suburbs are not parts of a large group of houses and businesses, but rather parts of a house, a state, and residential areas, respectively. Large city is a possible answer, but it is not as specific and accurate as downtown."
