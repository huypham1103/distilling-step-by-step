Compare the options He never took for granted living in the land of the free, for he was once a what abroad?, caged in, see work, slavery topfree and identify the most likely answer to the question 'prisoner'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""He never took for granted living in the land of the free, for he was once a what abroad?"" is **(E) prisoner**. This is because the phrase ""living in the land of the free"" implies that the person was living in a country that values freedom and democracy, such as the United States. The contrast with being a prisoner abroad suggests that the person was captured or detained by a foreign government or group that violated their human rights. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. For example, ""caged in"" and ""slavery"" are not usually used to describe a person's status in another country, but rather a condition of oppression or exploitation. ""See work"" is not a common term and could be a typo for ""sea work"" or ""seawork"", which are also not relevant to the sentence.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question ""He never used window cleaner on his screen, he had heard it wasn't good for cleaning his computer's what?"" is **(D) monitor**. This is because the word ""screen"" can refer to both a window and a computer monitor, and window cleaner is a product that is used to clean glass surfaces, such as windows. However, window cleaner can damage the coating or the pixels of a computer monitor, which is why it is not recommended to use it for cleaning a computer screen. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. For example, ""theatre"", ""movies"", and ""drive in movie"" are not parts of a computer, but rather forms of entertainment that can be watched on a screen. ""Closet"" is a place where clothes or other items are stored, which has nothing to do with cleaning a computer screen.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question ""He often got thirsty at night and needed a drink, so he always had a night table everywhere he had lived in all his what?"" is **(E) homes**. This is because the word ""homes"" refers to the places where a person lives or has lived in the past, and it is common for people to have a night table or a bedside table in their bedrooms, where they can keep a glass of water or other items that they might need at night. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. For example, ""furniture store"" is a place where furniture is sold, not where people live. ""Life"" is a general term that encompasses all the experiences and events of a person, not a specific location. ""Hallway"" is a part of a building that connects different rooms, not a place where people usually sleep or have a night table.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question ""He opened up the advertisement after reading the subject line, what kind of ad was it?"" is **(E) email**. This is because the phrase ""reading the subject line"" implies that the person was looking at an electronic message that has a header that summarizes the content or the purpose of the message, which is a common feature of emails. An email can also contain advertisements or promotional messages from various sources, such as companies, organizations, or individuals. The other options do not match well with the context of the sentence. For example, ""magazine"" and ""web page"" are types of media that can display advertisements, but they do not have subject lines.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question ""He planted an apple tree outside of Concord, what is the state it was planted in?"" is **(C) New Hampshire**. This is because Concord is the capital city of the state of New Hampshire, which is located in the northeastern region of the United States. New Hampshire is known for its natural beauty and its production of apples and other fruits. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. For example, ""grapes"" is not a state, but a type of fruit that grows on vines, not trees. ""Washington state"" is another state in the United States, but it is located in the northwest, far away from New Hampshire. ""Rhode Island"" is also a state in the United States, but it is the smallest one and does not have any cities named Concord.

Compare the options He played the bass fiddle professionally, but for his baby he used it to play a fun simple what?, music, jazz band, orchestra nursery rhyme and identify the most likely answer to the question 'music store'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question ""He played the bass fiddle professionally, but for his baby he used it to play a fun simple what?"" is **(D) nursery rhyme**. This is because a nursery rhyme is a type of song or poem that is usually intended for children, especially young ones, and that often has a simple and catchy melody and rhythm. A bass fiddle, also known as a double bass or a contrabass, is a large string instrument that produces low-pitched sounds and that is often used in classical, jazz, or folk music. It is possible for a person who plays the bass fiddle professionally to use it to play a nursery rhyme for their baby, as a way of entertaining or soothing them. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. For example, ""music"" is a general term that encompasses all kinds of sounds and styles, not a specific type of song or genre. ""Jazz band"" and ""orchestra"" are groups of musicians that play different instruments, not songs or melodies. ""Music store"" is a place where musical instruments or recordings are sold, not played.

Compare the options He promised he would fight enemy over the transgression, even if it was to the what?, victory, casualties, death eat and identify the most likely answer to the question 'dying'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question ""He promised he would fight enemy over the transgression, even if it was to the what?"" is **(C) death**. This is because the word ""death"" refers to the end of life or the cessation of vital functions, and it is often used to express the idea of extreme or ultimate sacrifice or commitment. The phrase ""even if it was to the death"" implies that the person was willing to risk their own life or to kill their enemy in order to defend their honor or their cause, regardless of the consequences. The other options do not match well with the context of the sentence. For example, ""victory"" and ""casualties"" are terms that relate to the outcome or the effects of a fight or a war, not the extent or the intensity of it. ""Eat"" is a verb that means to consume food, which has nothing to do with fighting or transgression. ""Dying"" is a gerund that means the process or the act of dying, which is different from the noun ""death"".

Compare the options He put in a mighty effort to his solution, but a better one was discovered making his what?, unimportant, innovative, insignificant helpless and identify the most likely answer to the question 'powerless'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question ""He put in a mighty effort to his solution, but a better one was discovered making his what?"" is **(C) insignificant**. This is because the word ""insignificant"" means having little or no importance, value, or impact, and it is often used to describe something that is overshadowed or surpassed by something else. The sentence suggests that the person worked hard to find a solution to a problem or a challenge, but someone else found a better one, making the person's solution irrelevant or useless. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. For example, ""unimportant"" and ""powerless"" are synonyms of ""insignificant"", but they are not as strong or as precise as the word ""insignificant"". ""Innovative"" means introducing or using new ideas or methods, which is not necessarily the case for the person's solution, especially if it was inferior to another one. ""Helpless"" means unable to defend oneself or to act effectively, which is not directly related to the person's solution or effort.

Compare the options He read book after book, he always liked to do what things?, travel new places, learn new, learn to read enjoyable and identify the most likely answer to the question 'bored'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question ""He read book after book, he always liked to do what things?"" is **(B) learn new**. This is because the phrase ""learn new"" means to acquire new knowledge, skills, or information, and it is often used to describe the motivation or the benefit of reading books. Reading books can expose a person to different topics, perspectives, genres, and styles, and can help them expand their horizons and their understanding of the world. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. For example, ""travel new places"" and ""enjoyable"" are not things, but rather actions or adjectives. ""Learn to read"" is a redundant phrase, since the person already knows how to read if they are reading book after book. ""Bored"" is an adjective that means feeling weary or uninterested, which is the opposite of what the person likes to do.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","10. The most likely answer to the question ""He really enjoyed the restaurant, when he got home he gave it what?"" is **(D) good review**. This is because a good review is a type of feedback or evaluation that expresses a positive opinion or a high rating of something, such as a restaurant, a product, a service, or a performance. It is common for people who enjoy a restaurant to give it a good review, either online or offline, as a way of showing their appreciation or recommending it to others.

","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) car**. This is because a car is a common vehicle for family road trips, and it has a back seat where one can sit and stare out the window. The other options are not very plausible, as a building is not a vehicle, an ocean is not something one can sit in, a computer screen is not something one can stare out of, and a bus is not usually associated with family road trips.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) anyway**. This is because anyway is a word that implies a threat or a warning, and it fits the context of someone wanting in on something and threatening to tattle if they are not allowed.
