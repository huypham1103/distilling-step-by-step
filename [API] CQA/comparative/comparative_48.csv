Some examples of curved swords are scimitars, sabers, katanas, and sickles. A curved sword might be preferred by someone who wants a different type of blade than a straight sword, which is more common and conventional. The other options are not very plausible, because:

","2. The most likely answer to the question is **(B) upset stomach**. An upset stomach is a condition that causes discomfort or pain in the abdomen, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite. An upset stomach might make someone unable to eat or even stand the idea of having food. The other options are not very convincing, because:
    - (A) gas: Gas is a condition that causes excess air or gas to accumulate in the digestive tract, often resulting in bloating, belching, or flatulence. Gas might make someone feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, but it does not necessarily prevent them from eating or wanting food.
    - (C) digesting: Digesting is the process of breaking down food into nutrients that can be absorbed by the body. Digesting is a normal and essential function of the body, and it does not cause any negative symptoms or feelings. Digesting does not make someone unable to eat or stand the idea of having food.
    - (D) not hungry: Not hungry is a state of having no desire or need for food, usually because of being full, satisfied, or having other priorities. Not hungry is not a condition or a problem, but a subjective feeling that varies from person to person and situation to situation.

    - (E) feeling of fullness: Feeling of fullness is a sensation of having enough or too much food in the stomach, usually after eating a large or heavy meal. Feeling of fullness might make someone reluctant or unwilling to eat more, but it does not make them unable to eat or stand the idea of having food.

","3. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) compost pile**. A compost pile is a collection of organic matter, such as leaves, grass clippings, food scraps, or animal manure, that is decomposed by microorganisms into a rich and fertile soil amendment. A compost pile is a useful and environmentally friendly way of recycling organic waste and improving the quality of the soil. Someone who rakes up leaves might add them to a compost pile to make use of them and reduce the amount of trash. The other options are not very reasonable, because:
    - (A) trees: Trees are woody plants that have a trunk, branches, and leaves. Trees are the source of the leaves that fall to the ground, and they do not need or benefit from having more leaves added to them. Someone who rakes up leaves would not add them to trees, but rather remove them from trees.
    - (B) ground: Ground is the surface of the earth that covers the soil, rocks, and minerals. Ground is where the leaves fall and where they are raked up from. Someone who rakes up leaves would not add them to the ground, but rather take them away from the ground.

A forest is a natural habitat for many plants and animals, and it is also a source of oxygen, timber, and other resources. A forest might have many leaves on the ground, but someone who rakes up leaves would not add them to a forest, but rather collect them from a forest.
    - (D) blower: A blower is a device that produces a strong current of air, often used to move or remove dust, debris, or leaves. A blower might be used to blow away leaves from a certain area, but it does not collect or store them. Someone who rakes up leaves would not add them to a blower, but rather use a blower to get rid of them.

","4. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) peculiar**. Peculiar is an adjective that means strange, unusual, or uncommon. Peculiar is often used to describe something that is not normal or expected, and that might arouse curiosity or suspicion. Doctors might say that the side effects of a medicine are peculiar if they are rare, unexpected, or unexplained by the medicine's mechanism or dosage. The other options are not very appropriate, because:
    - (A) great: Great is an adjective that means very good, excellent, or outstanding. Great is often used to describe something that is of high quality, value, or importance, and that might inspire admiration or praise. Doctors would not say that the side effects of a medicine are great, unless they are being sarcastic or ironic, because side effects are usually negative or undesirable consequences of taking a medicine.
    - (B) distinguished: Distinguished is an adjective that means respected, honored, or eminent. Distinguished is often used to describe someone who has achieved a high level of recognition, reputation, or authority in a certain field or profession, and that might command respect or admiration. Doctors would not say that the side effects of a medicine are distinguished, because side effects are not achievements or honors, but rather complications or risks of taking a medicine.
    - (C) remarkable: Remarkable is an adjective that means extraordinary, amazing, or noteworthy. Remarkable is often used to describe something that is very impressive, surprising, or worthy of attention, and that might elicit admiration or astonishment. Doctors might say that the side effects of a medicine are remarkable if they are very severe, unusual, or rare, but this would not be a positive or neutral term, but rather a negative or alarming one.
    - (D) excellent: Excellent is an adjective that means very good, superb, or outstanding. Excellent is often used to describe something that is of high quality, value, or performance, and that might meet or exceed expectations or standards. Doctors would not say that the side effects of a medicine are excellent, unless they are being sarcastic or ironic, because side effects are usually negative or undesirable consequences of taking a medicine.

Make wine is a complex and time-consuming process that involves harvesting, crushing, fermenting, aging, and bottling the grapes or fruits.

    - (C) wear jeans: Wear jeans is a phrase that means to put on jeans, which are pants made from denim or other sturdy fabrics.
