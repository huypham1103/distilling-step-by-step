Minting is the process of making coins, which is usually done by governments or authorized institutions. Crossing the street is a simple action that does not generate income. Feeling resentful is an emotion that does not help with making money. A machine part is an object that is used in a machine, not a way of making money.

The other options are not related to sharing knowledge or are very unlikely. Showing emotion is a way of expressing one's feelings, not one's knowledge. Working for free is a way of offering one's labor, not one's knowledge. Jaywalking is a violation of traffic rules that does not involve sharing knowledge.

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""The person wanted to use her ear to detect the buffalo herd, where did she put it?"" is **(D) ground**. This is because putting one's ear on the ground can help detect the vibrations caused by the movement of a large group of animals, such as a buffalo herd. The other options are not related to using one's ear to detect a buffalo herd or are very unlikely. Putting one's ear on the buffalo is dangerous and impractical, as the buffalo might attack or run away. Putting one's ear on one's head or on the side of one's head is the normal position of one's ear, which does not enhance one's hearing ability. A serial killer's bedroom is a very unlikely and irrelevant place to put one's ear, as it has nothing to do with buffalo herds.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question ""The person was always using mouthwash, why were they doing that?"" is **(C) white teeth**. This is because using mouthwash is a common and effective way of improving one's oral hygiene and whitening one's teeth by killing bacteria and removing stains. The other options are not related to using mouthwash or are very unlikely. Having a headache is a pain in one's head that does not require using mouthwash. Quenching one's thirst is a need for water that is not satisfied by using mouthwash. Having a source of income is a way of earning money that does not involve using mouthwash. Having a fair trial is a legal right that does not depend on using mouthwash.
