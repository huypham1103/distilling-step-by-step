","3. The most likely answer to the question is **country club**. This is because a country club is a place where people can take tennis lessons and pay for them. The other options are not suitable or realistic in this context. Wimbledon is a specific location where a famous tennis tournament is held, not a place where people can take lessons. A hospital is not a place where people play tennis, but rather a place where people get medical treatment.

","8. The most likely answer to the question is **incarceration**. This is because incarceration is a legal term that means being confined in a prison or jail as a punishment for a crime. The other options are not synonyms or equivalent terms in this context. Going to jail is a colloquial expression that means the same thing as incarceration, but it is not a formal or precise word. Imprisonment is a noun that means the state of being imprisoned, not the act of confining someone in prison. Sadness is an emotion that a person may feel after being convicted of murder, but it is not something that happens to them. Prosecution is the process of bringing someone to trial for a crime, not the outcome of the trial.

The other options are not comprehensive or consistent in this context. Execution is a specific type of punishment that involves putting someone to death, but it is not the only or the most common one.

","2. The most likely answer to the question 'When a play starts in an auditorium, what tends to fade out?' is **(A) lights**. This is because the lights in the auditorium are usually dimmed or turned off when a play begins, to create a dark and dramatic atmosphere. The other options are less likely because:
