4. The most likely answer to the question ""The shark was navigating across from the African coast to New York, where was it?"" is **(C) Atlantic Ocean**. This is because the Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's oceans and separates Africa from North America. Sharks can travel long distances in the Atlantic Ocean by using ocean currents and magnetic fields. Bathtub, seawater, saltwater, and sea world are less likely options because they are either too small, too general, or too artificial for the shark's journey.

5. The most likely answer to the question ""The shark was sick of the confines of its tank, what was it looking for?"" is **(E) tropical waters**. This is because tropical waters are more diverse and abundant in marine life than temperate or polar waters, and sharks are naturally curious and adventurous animals that enjoy exploring new environments.

","2. The most likely answer to the question ""The small dog had died and, the family treasured him a lot, where did they decide to place it?"" is **(A) coffin**. This is because the other options are either inappropriate or illogical for the situation. Denmark, New Hampshire, and bucket are not places where one would place a dead dog, especially if the family treasured him a lot. A basket might be used to transport the dog, but not to place it permanently. Therefore, the best option is that the family decided to place the dog in a coffin, which is a respectful and dignified way to handle the remains of a beloved pet.

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""The small dog looked longingly into the warm home and laughing family, what did it want?"" is **(A) own home**. This is because the other options are either irrelevant or contradictory to the question. A cold room, a suburb, or a nursing home are not things that the dog would want, especially when it sees a warm home and a happy family. An own house is the same as an own home, but it is redundant and less natural to say. Therefore, the best option is that the dog wanted its own home, where it could feel loved and comfortable.

","4. The most likely answer to the question ""The small dog spent a lot of time with the elderly, where did he volunteer?"" is **(B) nursing home**. This is because the other options are either incorrect or implausible for the question. An own house or a park are not places where the dog would volunteer, but rather where it would live or play. A suburb is a general area, not a specific place where the dog would volunteer. Therefore, the best option is that the dog volunteered at a nursing home, where it could spend time with the elderly and provide them with companionship and joy.

This is because the other options are either unrelated or unsuitable for the question. A big house, a dog show, a small apartment, or a limousine are not places where the dog would nap on the couch, but rather where it would live or visit. Therefore, the best option is that the dog loved naps on the couch in the living room, which is a common and cozy place for a homebody dog to rest.

","6. The most likely answer to the question ""The small locally owned beauty salon had it's grand opening, people hoped it would boost the economy in the surrounding what?"" is **(C) neighborhood**. This is because the other options are either irrelevant or too broad for the question. A clerk or a barber shop are not things that surround a beauty salon, but rather people or businesses that work in it. A city is too large and vague to be affected by a small beauty salon.

","8. The most likely answer to the question ""The snake was a cottonmouth. It was an American, from where?"" is **(A) Georgia**. This is because the other options are either incorrect or irrelevant for the question. A tree, a nature, or under the rocks are not places where a snake is from, but rather where it lives or hides. France is not a place where a cottonmouth snake is native to, but rather a country in Europe.

A pet, a rude, or a tropical forest are not things that a snake would do, but rather a noun, an adjective, or a place. A tree is a place where a snake might go, but not necessarily to warm up.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question 'The snake was worried about predators overhead, where did it go for cover?' is **(A) wooded area**. This is because a wooded area would provide more shelter and camouflage for the snake than the other options. A tropical forest might also have some cover, but it is not a specific enough answer. A warm place or a canyon would not protect the snake from aerial predators. A sleeping bag is an unlikely and unrealistic option for a snake.

","2. The most likely answer to the question 'The soldier was a great candidate for the job, the hiring officer knew the soldier could what?' is **(D) follow instructions**. This is because following instructions is an important skill for any job, especially for a soldier who has to obey orders and commands. Fighting or reporting for duty are specific to the military context, not the general job market. Amusing oneself or waiting for orders are not desirable qualities for a job candidate.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question 'The soldiers raised their rifles toward the invading soldiers with hate, what are they looking to do?' is **(A) destroy enemy**. This is because destroying the enemy is the ultimate goal of any war, and the soldiers are expressing their hatred and hostility toward the invaders. Waging or fighting a war are more general terms that do not capture the intensity of the situation. Having lunch is an irrelevant and absurd option. Stabbing to death is a specific method of killing that does not match the use of rifles.

Full of people or a lie are not desirable characteristics for a hiding place. Safety or being safe are not specific enough answers, as they do not describe the quality of the building.

","5. The most likely answer to the question 'The special interest group spent millions convincing young people they were changing society, but really they were just keeping people in two party lines and were just after their what?' is **(E) vote**. This is because the vote is the most valuable and influential thing that the special interest group can get from the young people, as it determines the outcome of the elections and the policies that affect society. Social activism or disruption, changing yourself, or riots are not the main objectives of the special interest group, but rather the means to persuade or manipulate the young people.

","6. The most likely answer to the question 'The spirit ascended to the after life, so what was it leaving?' is **(E) earth**. This is because earth is the physical realm where the spirit used to live before it died and moved on to the after life. A bar, a human being, a cemetery, or a graveyard are all specific locations or entities on earth that the spirit might have been associated with, but they are not the general term for the whole planet.

","7. The most likely answer to the question 'The spirit saw other like beings wandering aimlessly, where was it likely to be?' is **(E) haunted house**. This is because a haunted house is a common setting for stories or movies where spirits or ghosts are trapped or unable to move on to the after life. A human being, a bar, a haunted saloon, or a graveyard are not places where spirits would see other spirits, but rather where they might encounter living people or other creatures.

","9. The most likely answer to the question 'The spout was producing hardly a dribble, so fearing germs he began to look for another what?' is **(C) water fountain**. This is because a water fountain is a device that produces a stream of water for drinking or other purposes, and it has a spout that can be affected by low water pressure or contamination. A kettle, a teapot, a garage, or a gasoline can are not things that have spouts for drinking water, and they are not likely to be found in the same location as a water fountain.

This is because springing forth is a phrase that means to emerge or grow rapidly, and it is often used to describe the effect of spring on plants and animals. Dying, hibernating, lasting 100 years, or causing death are not things that life would do in response to spring, but rather to winter or other adverse conditions."
