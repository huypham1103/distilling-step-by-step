","2. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) scattering**. This is because scattering is a word that describes the action of moving quickly and randomly in different directions, which is what the alley cats would do after hearing a loud crash. The other options are not appropriate for the question or the context. Disburse, dispense, and spread are words that are more commonly used for money, liquids, or substances, not animals.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) ocean floor**. This is because anemones are marine animals that live on the ocean floor, and they are often harvested for their beauty or medicinal properties. The other options are not likely places where anemones are taken from. Tide pool is a small area of seawater that is separated from the ocean by rocks or sand, and it is not deep enough for anemones. Nursery is a place where plants or animals are raised or cared for, not harvested. Michigan is a state in the United States that does not have any anemones. Atlantic ocean is a large body of water that covers about 20% of the Earth's surface, but it is too vague and broad to answer the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) copulate**. This is because copulate is a verb that means to have sexual intercourse, and it is consistent with the context of the animals having sex by the water. The other options are not relevant or logical for the question or the context. Feel pain, die of cancer, and attack are negative or violent actions that do not match the tone of the sentence.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) baked**. This is because baked is a verb that means to cook or dry by exposure to heat, and it is a plausible consequence of the animals taking a mud bath in the sun. The other options are not reasonable or related to the question or the context. Feel pleasure, die of cancer, and procreate are actions that do not depend on the animals' behavior or environment.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question is **(B) need to eat**. This is because needing to eat is a possible reason why the animals would act rabid, which means furious or mad, at the sight of a bucket. The bucket could contain food or water that the animals want or need. The other options are not suitable or sensible for the question or the context. Fight each other, feared the bucket, and feel pain are actions or emotions that do not explain why the animals would act rabid.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) feel pleasure**. This is because feeling pleasure is a positive and natural sensation that the animals could experience when they are by the river, especially if they are not thirsty. The other options are not appropriate or coherent for the question or the context. Feel pain, die of cancer, and fly are negative or impossible actions that do not fit the scenario. Pass water is a euphemism for urinating, and it is not a likely thing that the animals would do when they are by the river.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","10. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) reproduce asexually**. This is because reproducing asexually is a biological process that involves producing offspring without the involvement of another individual, and it is hard for animals that are not good at swimming to do this. The other options are not relevant or reasonable for the question or the context. Pass water, bathe, and feel pleasure are actions that do not require swimming skills or have anything to do with reproduction. Listen to each other is a communication skill that does not depend on swimming ability or relate to reproduction."

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""The annoying person always had a comment to share, he must think he must what?"" is **(A) know everything**. This is because the phrase ""he must think he must"" implies that the person has a high opinion of himself and his knowledge, and that he does not respect the opinions of others. The other choices do not fit well with the context of the question. For example, (B) compliments does not make sense because the person is not seeking praise, but rather imposing his views. (C) confidence is not a good answer because the person may be confident, but that is not the reason why he always has a comment to share. (D) care about is also not a good answer because the person does not seem to care about the feelings or thoughts of others, but only his own. (E) spare time is irrelevant to the question, as the person may have a lot or a little spare time, but that does not explain why he always has a comment to share.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question ""The antarctic ocean touches a few others, but the next in line alphabetically is which one?"" is **(E) pacific**. This is because the antarctic ocean, also known as the southern ocean, surrounds the continent of Antarctica and touches the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. If we arrange these oceans in alphabetical order, the next one after the antarctic ocean is the pacific ocean. The other choices are not correct because (A) indian ocean comes before the antarctic ocean alphabetically, (B) atlantic is the same as the antarctic ocean, (C) antarctic is not an ocean, but a continent, and (D) medium is not an ocean, but a size.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question ""The apple tree was located outside the car factory, it was one of many where?"" is **(E) detroit**. This is because Detroit is a city in the United States that is known for its automobile industry and has many car factories. It is also a place where apple trees can grow, as Michigan, the state where Detroit is located, is one of the top apple-producing states in the country.
