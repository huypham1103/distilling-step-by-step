Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question 'The tennis court enjoyed older, more refined clientele, where was it located?' is **(C) health club**. This is because a health club is a place where people can exercise and enjoy various amenities, such as tennis courts, swimming pools, spas, etc. It is likely that older and more refined people would prefer such a place over other options. For example, 'college campus' would imply that the tennis court is used by young and inexperienced students, which is not consistent with the description.

","5. The most likely answer to the question 'The terrace overlooked a section of the Grand River, where was the terrace located?' is **(D) michigan**. This is because the Grand River is a river that flows through the state of Michigan in the United States. It is possible that a terrace, which is a raised platform or balcony, could overlook a section of the river. The other options are either too vague or too specific to match the question. For example, 'state' could refer to any state in the US or elsewhere, while 'southern europe' is a region that does not have the Grand River.

A therapist would likely advise their clients to work on their communication skills and to talk to each other as a way of resolving their issues. The other options are either irrelevant or contradictory to the question. For example, 'persuaded' is a verb that means to convince someone to do something, not something to work on, while 'laughing' is a reaction that may or may not indicate good communication.

This is because talking with people is a form of communication that involves sharing one's thoughts and feelings with others. A therapist would likely suggest that someone who has problems should be willing to talk with people who can help them, such as friends, family, or professionals.

","10. The most likely answer to the question 'The ticket booth informed riders that the train was running late, so where was the ticket booth located?' is **(D) metro station**. This is because a metro station is a place where people can board or exit trains that run underground or above ground in a city. A ticket booth is a place where people can buy or validate tickets for the train. It is logical that a ticket booth at a metro station would inform riders about the train schedule and any delays.
