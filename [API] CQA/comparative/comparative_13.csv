Because of this, he missed what?, tickets, plane, suitcase pocket and identify the most likely answer to the question 'airport'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(B) plane**. James lost his return ticket, which means he could not board the plane back to his destination. He missed the plane because he did not have a valid ticket. The other choices are not directly related to the consequence of losing a return ticket. Tickets are what he lost, not what he missed. Suitcase, pocket, and airport are not things that he would necessarily miss because of losing his ticket. He could still have his suitcase and pocket, and he could still go to the airport, but he could not get on the plane.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) experience**. James loves judging things, but he can only base his judgments on his own experience, which is the sum of his knowledge, skills, and observations. The other choices are not relevant to the question. Misperception is a wrong or inaccurate perception, which is not something that James has to go on. Jury is a group of people who decide the outcome of a legal case, which is not related to James' judging things. Knowing yourself is a personal trait, not something that James has to go on. Ignorance is a lack of knowledge or awareness, which is not something that James has to go on.

"James needed more sleep at night, so he did what earlier?","['get into bed', 'closed his eyes', 'go to sleep', 'relax', 'rest']","Questions: James needed more sleep at night, so he did what earlier?, Choices: (A) get into bed, (B) closed his eyes, (C) go to sleep, (D) relax, (E) rest. Compare the options James needed more sleep at night, so he did what earlier?, get into bed, closed his eyes, go to sleep relax and identify the most likely answer to the question 'rest'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) rest**. James needed more sleep at night, so he did something earlier that would help him fall asleep faster and sleep longer. Resting is a state of relaxation and calmness that reduces stress and fatigue, which are factors that affect sleep quality. The other choices are not as likely as rest. Getting into bed, closing his eyes, and going to sleep are actions that James would do at night, not earlier. Relaxing is similar to resting, but it is not as specific as rest. Relaxing could mean doing any activity that makes James feel comfortable and happy, such as reading, listening to music, or watching TV, which may not necessarily help him sleep better.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) believe in god**. A religion is a type of group that is based on a common belief in a god or gods, and a set of doctrines and practices that relate to that belief. Members of a religion have this belief in god in common, which is what defines their group identity and affiliation. The other choices are not as likely as believe in god. Talking to each other, paying bills, learning from each other, and believing in ghosts are not things that are specific to members of a religion. They are things that anyone can do, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof.

His nose bled, and some blood covered Jame's what?, hands, fingers, fists anger and identify the most likely answer to the question 'hitting'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) fists**. James punched a man again and again, which means he used his fists to strike the man's face. His nose bled, and some blood covered James' fists, which were in contact with the man's nose. The other choices are not as likely as fists. Hands and fingers are parts of the fists, but they are not as precise as fists. Anger and hitting are not things that can be covered by blood. They are emotions and actions, not physical objects.

What did James have to do to the stairs?, lower, push down, demotion pay cut and identify the most likely answer to the question 'repair'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) lower**. James raised the stairs, which means he lifted them up or made them higher. But John wanted to get up too, which means he wanted to use the stairs to go to a higher level. What James had to do to the stairs was to lower them, which means to bring them down or make them lower, so that John could access them. The other choices are not as likely as lower. Pushing down, demotion, and pay cut are not things that James could do to the stairs. They are actions that apply to different contexts, such as pushing down a button, demoting an employee, or cutting someone's salary. Repairing the stairs is not something that James had to do, unless the stairs were broken or damaged, which is not implied by the question.

","7. The most likely answer to the question is **(B) cafe**. James sat down and looked at the menu, then he placed an order, which are actions that people typically do in a cafe, which is a place where people can buy and consume food and drinks. The other choices are not as likely as cafe. Shop, internet sites, and advertisement are not places where people can sit down, look at menus, and place orders. They are places where people can buy or view different products or services, but not necessarily consume them. Table is not a place, but an object that people can sit at, but it does not specify where the table is located.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) sink**. James shaved, which means he used a razor or a similar tool to cut off his facial hair. But this left a lot of hair where he shaved, which is likely to be the sink, which is a basin that is usually attached to a faucet and a drain, and that is used for washing or shaving. The other choices are not as likely as sink. Arm and person's head are not places where James would shave, unless he had hair on his arm or head, which is not implied by the question. Floor is a possible place where hair could fall, but it is not as likely as sink, because sink is closer to where James shaved. Moustache is not a place, but a type of facial hair that James could have shaved, but it does not specify where the hair went after shaving.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) locomotion**. James spent a lot of time walking long distances, which means he used walking as his only means of locomotion, which is the ability or act of moving from one place to another. He walked not because he liked it, but because he had no other choice of locomotion, such as a car, a bike, or a bus. The other choices are not as likely as locomotion. Losing weight, moving forward, blisters, and meditation are not means of locomotion, but possible outcomes or effects of walking. Losing weight is a result of burning calories, moving forward is a direction of walking, blisters are injuries caused by friction, and meditation is a mental state of awareness and calmness.

","10. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) painting**. James spent his days at his cottage trying to capture the beauty of the landscape, which means he tried to paint the landscape, which is a type of art that depicts natural scenery, such as mountains, fields, trees, or rivers. But he wasn't good at painting, which means he lacked the skill or talent to create realistic or appealing paintings. The other choices are not as likely as painting. Mountains, dense areas, village, and countryside are not things that James tried to capture, but parts of the landscape that he tried to paint. They are not things that he could be good or bad at, but things that he could like or dislike."

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""James stove didn't work, so he had to cook where?"" is **(E) friend's house**. This is because cooking in a bathroom, a tent, or a living room is not very practical or sanitary. Cooking in an apartment is possible, but it does not explain why James's stove did not work. Cooking at a friend's house is a reasonable alternative when one's own stove is broken.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question ""James thought that analyzing all the data would help him learn more, but it did not.  It only gave him what?"" is **(A) headache**. This is because analyzing a lot of data can be tedious, confusing, and frustrating, especially if it does not yield any useful insights. A headache is a common symptom of stress and mental fatigue. A better understanding, enlightenment, or discovering truth are positive outcomes of data analysis, not negative ones. Papercuts are unlikely to result from data analysis, unless James was using a lot of paper documents.

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""James thought that he was original, but really his story was exactly like many others.   Sarah didn't want to hurt his feelings so she didn't say anything.  What might she have done while listening?"" is **(D) derivative**. This is because a derivative work is one that is based on or imitates another work, without adding anything new or creative. James's story was not original, but a copy of many others. Sarah might have thought that his story was derivative, but she did not want to criticize him. A remake, a copy, or a reproduction are synonyms for derivative, but they are not actions that Sarah might have done while listening. A simile is a figure of speech that compares two things using ""like"" or ""as"", which is not relevant to the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question ""James thought that the desk was built with solidity, but when he rapped on it he could hear what?"" is **(C) hollowness**. This is because a hollow object is one that has an empty space inside, which can produce a sound when tapped or knocked. James expected the desk to be solid, but he discovered that it was hollow when he rapped on it. Openness, instability, strange sounds, or weakness are not qualities that can be heard, but rather seen, felt, or inferred.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question ""James tried to arise from the lunch table, where he had done what?"" is **(E) lie down**. This is because lying down is the opposite of arising, and it implies that James was very tired, lazy, or sick. Falling down, sitting down, going ahead, or sitting down are not actions that would make it difficult for James to arise from the lunch table.

","6. The most likely answer to the question ""James used an axe and a saw to chop wood, shape it, and make a shelter.  He kept adding wood to it, building it bigger and bigger, until it became a what?"" is **(C) house**. This is because a house is a large and permanent structure that can be used as a dwelling. James started with a small and temporary shelter, but he expanded it into a house by adding more wood. A shelterbelt is a row of trees or shrubs that protects an area from wind or erosion, which is not what James was making. A tree is a living plant that grows from the ground, which is not what James was making. A home is a place where one lives or feels comfortable, which is a subjective concept that depends on James's feelings. A bus stop is a place where buses stop to pick up or drop off passengers, which is not what James was making.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question ""James uses television late in the day, after work.  It does so because his work is hard and he wants to be what?"" is **(C) entertained**. This is because entertainment is a form of activity that provides amusement, enjoyment, or pleasure. James uses television to relax and have fun after a hard day at work. Laziness, falling asleep, visual, or conformity are not reasons why James uses television, but rather possible consequences or characteristics of his behavior.

He was afraid that if the neighbors knew, they'd all want to use it, and it would turn his house into what?"" is **(E) resort**. This is because a resort is a place that offers recreation, relaxation, or entertainment, often with facilities such as pools, spas, or golf courses. James wanted to enjoy the benefits of a spa at his own house, but he did not want to share it with his neighbors. A country club, a health centre, a hospital, or a backyard are not places that are associated with spas or hot tubs, or that would attract a lot of visitors.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question ""James wanted his anemone to grow and bloom, so he put it in what?"" is **(B) tide pool**. This is because an anemone is a type of marine animal that resembles a flower, and that lives in shallow water among rocks and coral. James wanted his anemone to thrive in its natural habitat, so he put it in a tide pool. A flower shop, a flower pot, a seafood restaurant, or a pool are not places where an anemone can grow and bloom, but rather places where it might be sold, planted, eaten, or kept as a pet.

With that he'd be able to have two people stay over, one in the guest room, and one on the sofa.  Where might he have been?"" is **(E) house**. This is because a house is a type of dwelling that usually has more than one room, and that can accommodate guests.

","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) commercial building**. This is because a concert hall is a type of commercial building that requires a specific zoning designation to operate. The other options are either irrelevant or too broad for the question. For example, a theater is a subset of a concert hall, and a city is not a zoning category.
