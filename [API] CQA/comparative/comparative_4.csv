","1. The most likely answer to the question 'He didn't want his son to be soft, so he was always what on him?' is **(D) firm**. This is because being firm means being strict and demanding, which could make someone less soft or weak. The other choices do not fit well with the sentence. Hard, sandpaper, and abrasive are all synonyms that imply harshness or roughness, which are not the same as being firm. Loud does not make sense in this context, as it is not a way of being on someone.

","2. The most likely answer to the question 'He drank coffee every morning on his commute, he said it gave him energy for what?' is **(C) work**. This is because work is a common activity that requires energy and motivation, and coffee is a stimulant that can boost both. The other choices are not very relevant or logical.

Obesity and fatigue are negative outcomes that coffee might prevent or reduce, but not give energy for.

Continuous motion and rolling down street are actions that a ball can do, but not qualities that a drawing can have. Spherical and round are three-dimensional shapes that a ball can be, but not a drawing.

Sit down is a posture that one can adopt while watching a film, but not something that one would do intently. Quite is a misspelling of quiet, which is an adjective, not a verb.
