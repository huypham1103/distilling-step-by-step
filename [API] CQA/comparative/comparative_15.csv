","1. The most likely answer to the question ""Mark's semen was very thick, but after his vasectomy it was also what?"" is **(D) clear**.

This means that the semen, which is the fluid that carries the sperm, will no longer contain any sperm after a vasectomy. Sperm makes up only a small percentage of the semen, but it can affect its color and consistency. Without sperm, the semen may become more clear and less thick. The other options are not likely because they do not describe how the semen would change after a vasectomy. Blank, sparse, thin, and free flowing are not common terms to describe semen.
