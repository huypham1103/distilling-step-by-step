The word ""House"" in this context is most likely referring to a student organization or a residential hall in a high school or college. For example, some schools have houses that are named after famous alumni or historical figures, and students belong to one of them based on their academic or extracurricular interests. The other options are not as plausible because they are either too specific or too general. For example, an assisted living facility and an old people's home are places where elderly people live and receive care, but they are not usually called ""House"". A republican party is a political party that has members who are elected to the House of Representatives, but this is a different meaning of ""House"" than the one in the question. An organization is a very broad term that can refer to any group of people who work together for a common purpose, but it does not explain why Sally is a senior in it.

","5. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) hardware store**. Sally went out to look for a stepladder. Where might she have gone? A hardware store is a place that sells tools, equipment, and materials for various projects and repairs. A stepladder is a type of ladder that has flat steps and can stand on its own. It is often used to reach high places or to work on ceilings or walls. The other options are not as reasonable because they are either unlikely or impractical. For example, a construction worker's vehicle is a vehicle that belongs to someone who works in the construction industry, but it is not a place where Sally can go and buy a stepladder. A tool shed is a small building where tools and equipment are stored, but it is not a place where Sally can go and find a stepladder unless she already owns one. An elevator is a device that moves people or goods up and down in a building, but it is not a place where Sally can go and look for a stepladder.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) buying beer**. She was hitting bottle to the point that doing what would seem like sobering up even though it wasn't? To hit the bottle means to drink alcohol excessively or habitually. To sober up means to become less drunk or intoxicated. Buying beer is an action that would seem like sobering up because it implies that she is not drinking at the moment, but it is not actually sobering up because it suggests that she is planning to drink more later. The other options are not as fitting because they are either unrelated or contradictory. For example, a table is a piece of furniture that has nothing to do with the question. Alcoholism is a condition that involves a dependence on alcohol, but it is not an action that she was doing. Aim is a goal or purpose that one tries to achieve, but it is not something that she was doing. Michigan is a state in the United States, but it is not something that she was doing.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) spend money**. She would only buy things on sale as to what? To buy things on sale means to purchase items that are offered at a lower price than usual. The phrase ""as to"" means ""in order to"" or ""with the intention of"". Therefore, the question is asking what she was trying to achieve by buying things on sale. The most logical answer is that she was trying to save money, which is the opposite of spending money. The other options are not as sensible because they are either irrelevant or inconsistent. For example, selling is an action that involves exchanging goods or services for money, but it is not something that she was trying to do by buying things on sale. Getting money is a result that involves receiving or earning money, but it is not something that she was trying to do by buying things on sale.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) perfume**. She'd sooner just spray herself with water than the what she didn't like the smell of? To spray oneself with water means to apply water to one's body using a device that produces a fine mist. The word ""sooner"" means ""more quickly"" or ""more willingly"". Therefore, the question is asking what she disliked so much that she would prefer to spray herself with water instead of using it. The most reasonable answer is that she disliked the smell of perfume, which is a liquid that has a pleasant or distinctive scent and is applied to the skin or clothing. The other options are not as suitable because they are either nonsensical or unlikely. For example, air is a mixture of gases that surrounds the earth and is essential for breathing, but it is not something that she can spray herself with or dislike the smell of. A fountain is a structure that shoots water into the air, but it is not something that she can spray herself with or dislike the smell of.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""The middle of a trip comes after the what?"" is **(E) beginning**. This is because a trip usually has three stages: the beginning, the middle, and the end. The middle of a trip comes after the beginning and before the end.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question ""The revolving door had an emergency security lock because of all the money where?"" is **(C) bank**. This is because a bank is a place where a lot of money is stored and exchanged, and therefore it needs a high level of security. A revolving door with an emergency lock can prevent robbers from escaping or entering the bank. The other options are not as likely because they do not have as much money or need as much security as a bank. For example, a jewelry store may have valuable items, but not as much cash as a bank, a mall may have many stores, but not a single place with a lot of money, a hotel lobby may have guests, but not a lot of money, and a public place may have people, but not a lot of money.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question ""The roadway led away from town and towards what?"" is **(E) countryside**. This is because a countryside is a rural area that is usually opposite to a town or a city. A roadway that leads away from town implies that it is going to a less populated and less urbanized area, which is the countryside. The other options are not as likely because they are not opposite to a town or a city. For example, a neighborhood is a part of a town or a city, not away from it, a city is a larger and more urbanized area than a town, not away from it, an environment is a general term that can include both town and countryside, not away from it, and a metropolis is a very large and densely populated city, not away from it.

","4. The most likely answer to the question ""The roses flowered in June. Sarah loved smelling the what?"" is **(A) blossom**. This is because a blossom is a flower that has opened or bloomed, and roses are a type of flower. Sarah loved smelling the blossom means that she enjoyed the fragrance of the roses when they flowered in June. The other options are not as likely because they are not related to the roses or their smell. For example, a vase is a container that can hold flowers, but it does not have a smell, a park is a public place that can have flowers, but it is not specific to roses, a cast shadow is a dark area that is formed by an object blocking the light, but it does not have a smell, and open is an adjective that can describe a flower, but it is not a noun that can be smelled.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question ""The round piece of road did well to slow down traffic versus the long what to a stop?"" is **(E) straight**. This is because a round piece of road is a curve or a bend that can force drivers to slow down and be more careful, while a long straight road is a road that has no curves or bends and can allow drivers to speed up and be less careful. The round piece of road did well to slow down traffic versus the long straight road to a stop means that the curve was more effective in reducing the speed and the risk of accidents than the straight road. The other options are not as likely because they are not opposite to a round piece of road. For example, a square is a shape that has four equal sides and four right angles, but it is not a type of road, a roundleaf is a plant that has round leaves, but it is not a type of road, a flat is an adjective that can describe a road, but it is not a noun that can be compared to a round piece of road, and a winding is a verb that can describe a road, but it is not a noun that can be compared to a round piece of road"
