","10. The most likely answer to the question 'What does someone feel when they run away from a big animal?' is **(D) frightened**. This is because frightened is the most appropriate and logical emotion to feel when one is in danger or threatened by a big animal, and the other options are either actions that one may or may not take while running away from a big animal (**(A) stretches, (B) go faster, (C) get away from**), or unrelated to the question (**(E) manual**).

I hope this helps you understand the questions and the choices better. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask me. 😊"
