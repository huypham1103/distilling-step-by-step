","10. The most likely answer to the question 'What low area between mountains can an apple tree be typically found?' is **(A) valley**. A valley is a low area of land that is surrounded by hills or mountains, and often has a river or a stream flowing through it. Valleys can have fertile soil and a mild climate, which are suitable for growing apple trees. Therefore, a low area between mountains where an apple tree can be typically found is a valley, or a depression in the landscape. The other options are not low areas between mountains, but nouns that do not describe the geography or the vegetation of a place. Washington state is a state in the United States that has some mountains and some apple orchards, but is not a low area. Open is an adjective that means not enclosed or covered, countryside is a term that refers to the rural areas outside the city, and fields are areas of land that are used for farming or sports."
