Compare the options She put on some soft music, she just wanted to do what at the end of the day?, dance, opera, listen relax and identify the most likely answer to the question 'skate'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question 'She put on some soft music, she just wanted to do what at the end of the day?' is **(D) relax**. This is because relaxing is a common activity that people do at the end of the day, especially when they listen to soft music. The other options are less likely because they involve more energy or effort, such as dancing, opera, or skating. Listening is also less likely because it is not a specific action, but rather a passive state.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question 'She really enjoyed to make bread, because when you made your own it was always what?' is **(E) tastes better than storebought**. This is because taste is a subjective and personal preference that can motivate people to make their own bread. The other options are less likely because they are either objective facts or irrelevant statements. Fresher and healthier are facts that apply to any homemade food, not just bread. I'm hungry and eat bread are not reasons why someone would enjoy making bread.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question 'She really wanted her husband to pick a place to have dinner, but he was so used to her choosing he just replied with what?' is **(A) wherever**. This is because wherever is a common and vague response that indicates a lack of preference or decision. The other options are less likely because they are either unrelated or nonsensical. Medium is a term for cooking meat, not choosing a place. Void and nowhere are negative and empty words that do not fit the context. Being is a noun, not an answer.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question 'She said it was her turn to watch television, it was time for her to what?' is **(D) see favorite show**. This is because seeing a favorite show is a plausible and specific reason why someone would want to watch television. The other options are less likely because they are either too general or irrelevant. Entertained and plug in are vague and broad terms that do not explain what someone wants to watch. You're bored is a statement about the listener, not the speaker. Sit is an action, not a purpose.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question 'She said you had to pay extra for her to swallow semen, something you'd only hear from a what?' is **(B) prostitute**. This is because a prostitute is a person who sells sexual services for money, and swallowing semen is a sexual act that some clients may request. The other options are less likely because they are either inappropriate or inaccurate. You're curious and you're into are not professions, but personal traits. Pornstar is a person who performs sexual acts on camera, not for individual clients. Gay man in love is a sexual orientation and a relationship status, not a job.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question 'Some people add up to something, but others put in no effort in their lives ending with what result?' is **(A) amount to nothing**. This is because amounting to nothing is a common and negative expression that describes someone who has no achievements or success in life. The other options are less likely because they are either irrelevant or positive. Talking loudly and mathematics are not results, but actions or subjects. Learn from each other and state facts are not negative, but constructive or informative.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question 'Some people are morning people, others don't get going until after lunch in the what?' is **(D) afternoon**. This is because afternoon is the time of day that follows lunch, and it makes sense that some people are more productive or energetic in the afternoon than in the morning. The other options are less likely because they are either incorrect or redundant. Night time and nighttime are the same word, and they are not the time of day that follows lunch. Dusk is the time of day when the sun sets, not when people have lunch. Morning is the opposite of afternoon, and it does not fit the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question 'Some people believe that giving assistance to those in need will remove their ability to assist themselves, building what?' is **(C) dependence**. This is because dependence is a state or condition of relying on someone or something else for support or help. Some people may believe that giving assistance to those in need will create or increase their dependence, and reduce their self-reliance or autonomy. The other options are less likely because they are either positive or irrelevant. Good will and helpfulness are positive outcomes of giving assistance, not negative ones. Smiles and problems are not states or conditions, but expressions or situations.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question 'Some people don't have insurance, they can expect a long wait in the waiting room when they go to the walk in what?' is **(E) clinic**. This is because a clinic is a place where people can receive medical care or treatment, especially for minor or urgent issues. A walk in clinic is a type of clinic that does not require appointments, but may have long waiting times for patients without insurance. The other options are less likely because they are either specific or uncommon. Maternity ward and dentist's office are not places where people can walk in without appointments, and they are not for general medical care. Doctor's office and private doctor are not terms that indicate a walk in service, and they may not accept patients without insurance.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","10. The most likely answer to the question 'Some people get carried away with shopping, they'll often be buying products they wouldn't even find themselves what?' is **(E) wrapping**. This is because wrapping is an action that people do when they buy products as gifts for others, and it implies that they do not intend to use the products themselves. The other options are less likely because they are either obvious or unrelated. Being able to use is a basic requirement for buying any product, not a specific criterion. Disagreements and spending money are not actions that people do with products, but with people or resources. Economic boom is a macroeconomic phenomenon, not a personal behavior."

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question ""Some people really loved beer, they call it what gold?"" is **(C) liquid**. This is because beer is a type of liquid, and some people may refer to it as liquid gold because of its color and value. The other options are not as relevant or accurate. Alcohol in is not a complete phrase, intoxicating is an adjective that describes the effect of beer, not the beer itself, hair of the dog is a slang term for drinking alcohol to cure a hangover, and harmful is a negative word that does not match the tone of the question.

","2. The most likely answer to the question ""Some say they are at odds, but many find solace in both science and what?"" is **(C) religion**. This is because religion is a common topic that is often seen as conflicting with science, but also a source of comfort and meaning for many people.

Depression, wrong, and rememberance are all negative words that suggest sadness and regret, which contradict the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question ""Stopping being married to one another was a costly task, the lawyers and their what were astronomical?"" is **(D) legal fees**. This is because legal fees are the expenses that lawyers charge for their services, which are often very high and can make a divorce more expensive. The other options are not as relevant or sensible. Free time, pleasure, and get divorced are not things that lawyers have or do, and being lonely is not a quality that lawyers possess or cause.

The other options are not as relevant or reasonable. Hear news and attend school are not things that the CEO would do with the product, but rather sources of information or education.

Compare the options An astronout in space needed to know what side of the planet the English Channel was on, where did he aim his spacecraft?, northern hemisphere, atlantic ocean, go boating england and identify the most likely answer to the question 'canada'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question ""An astronaut in space needed to know what side of the planet the English Channel was on, where did he aim his spacecraft?"" is **(B) atlantic ocean**. This is because the English Channel is a part of the Atlantic Ocean that separates England from France, and thus aiming the spacecraft at the Atlantic Ocean would help the astronaut locate the English Channel. The northern hemisphere, go boating, England, and Canada are less likely to help the astronaut, as they are either too broad, too specific, or too far from the English Channel.

Compare the options An atheist was asked what happens after dying, what was his response?, unable to work, born again, no longer exist would cease to exist and identify the most likely answer to the question 'body decays'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question ""An atheist was asked what happens after dying, what was his response?"" is **(C) no longer exist**. This is because an atheist is someone who does not believe in the existence of any gods or supernatural beings, and thus would not believe in any form of life after death. Unable to work, born again, would cease to exist, and body decays are less likely to be the response of an atheist, as they either imply some kind of continuation of existence, or are redundant or irrelevant.

Compare the options An electronics store had things damaged from the rain, where should these things be stored?, large city, strip mall, building shopping mall and identify the most likely answer to the question 'aquarium'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question ""An electronics store had things damaged from the rain, where should these things be stored?"" is **(C) building**. This is because a building is a structure that can provide shelter and protection from the rain and other weather elements, and thus prevent further damage to the electronics. A large city, a strip mall, a shopping mall, and an aquarium are less likely to be suitable places to store the electronics, as they either do not offer enough protection, or are too exposed or inappropriate for the electronics.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question ""An expressway can suffer from traffic, this traffic gets worse the closer you get to any what?"" is **(C) american city**. This is because an American city is a large and densely populated urban area that can generate a lot of traffic, especially during peak hours, and thus cause congestion on the expressway. Michigan, a map, rest stops, and a country are less likely to cause traffic on the expressway, as they are either too specific, too abstract, too sparse, or too large.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question ""Animals can be very primal, sometimes to prove themselves they what?"" is **(A) fight each other**. This is because fighting each other is a common way for animals to establish dominance, compete for resources, or defend their territory, and thus prove themselves in the animal kingdom. Needing to eat, being territorial, feeling pain, and living lives are less likely to be the answer, as they are either too general, too passive, too negative, or too vague.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question ""Animals suffer from some of the same things man does, it isn't uncommon for a pet to what?"" is **(D) die of cancer**. This is because cancer is a disease that can affect both humans and animals, and it is not uncommon for pets to die of cancer, especially if they are old or exposed to harmful substances. Bathing, copulating, licking on face, and biting are less likely to be the answer, as they are either too trivial, too natural, too affectionate, or too aggressive.

This is because prison is a common consequence for people who commit crimes or cause harm while under the influence of alcohol. The other options are not plausible places to spend 8 years.

The most likely answer to the question ""Ben was usually an eloquent speaker, but this time he had difficulty reading the words on the teleprompter, so he did much what?"" is **(A) stammering**. This is because stammering is a speech disorder that causes involuntary repetitions, prolongations, or blocks of sounds or syllables. It can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or unfamiliarity with the content. The other options are not appropriate descriptions of what Ben did.
