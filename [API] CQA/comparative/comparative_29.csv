This is because woods is a noun that refers to an area of land covered with trees, which matches the description of the woman's location. The other options are less likely because they are either too specific or too vague. Illinois, New York, and Indiana are all names of states in the US, but they do not indicate where exactly the woman was within those states.

This is because will is a modal verb that expresses certainty or strong intention, and being committed is a phrase that implies dedication or loyalty. The other options are less likely because they either contradict or weaken the woman's statement.

This is because getting pregnant is a verb phrase that refers to conceiving a child, and doctors usually advise women not to do so if they drink a lot of alcohol, as it can harm the fetus or cause complications. The other options are less likely because they are either irrelevant or nonsensical. Licking on floor, frequent urination, and throwing up are all verb phrases that describe actions that have nothing to do with drinking alcohol or getting pregnant.

","5. The most likely answer to the question ""The woman was okay with the bug since it was a predator of aphids, where did the bug live?"" is **(A) garden**. This is because garden is a noun that refers to a piece of land where plants or flowers are grown, and aphids are a type of insect that feed on plant sap and can damage crops or ornamental plants. The other options are less likely because they are either inappropriate or unlikely. Carpet, rug, and rock are all nouns that refer to objects or materials that do not provide a suitable habitat for bugs or aphids.

","6. The most likely answer to the question ""The woman was watching TV instead of going to the gym, what was she at risk of doing?"" is **(B) get fat**. This is because getting fat is a verb phrase that refers to gaining weight or becoming obese, and watching TV instead of going to the gym is a behavior that can lead to physical inactivity and overeating, which are risk factors for obesity. The other options are less likely because they are either positive or irrelevant. Entertainment is a noun that refers to something that amuses or pleases people, and it is not a risk, but a benefit, of watching TV. Arguments and break couch are both noun phrases that describe possible outcomes of watching TV, but they are not directly related to the woman's health or fitness. Wasting time is a verb phrase that refers to spending time unproductively or uselessly, but it is not a risk, but a consequence, of watching TV instead of going to the gym.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question ""The woman was worried about environmental impact, what did she fret over while attempting to wash clothes?"" is **(B) use water**. This is because using water is a verb phrase that refers to consuming or utilizing a natural resource that is essential for life and often scarce or polluted, and washing clothes is an activity that requires a lot of water and can generate wastewater. The other options are less likely because they are either trivial or unrelated. Picking up and gathering up are both verb phrases that refer to collecting or arranging something, but they do not have a significant environmental impact or cause for worry. Using soap is a verb phrase that refers to applying or adding a cleaning agent, but it is not necessarily harmful for the environment, depending on the type and amount of soap. Getting dirty is a verb phrase that refers to becoming soiled or stained, but it is not something that the woman would fret over while washing clothes, as it is the reason why she is washing them in the first place.

","8. The most likely answer to the question ""The woman was yelling obscenities in public, and while it was entertaining for people passing by, what did her husband feel?"" is **(B) embarrassment**. This is because embarrassment is a noun that refers to a feeling of shame or awkwardness, and the woman's husband would likely feel that way if his wife was behaving inappropriately or rudely in public. The other options are less likely because they are either positive or irrelevant. Happiness, fulfillment, and enjoyment are all nouns that refer to feelings of pleasure or satisfaction, and they are not likely to be felt by the woman's husband, as he would probably be displeased or annoyed by his wife's actions.

","9. The most likely answer to the question ""The women decided it was time to talk about the issue, they were tired of staying and what?"" is **(A) keeping quiet**. This is because keeping quiet is a verb phrase that refers to remaining silent or not speaking, and the women would be tired of doing that if they had an issue that they wanted to discuss or resolve. The other options are less likely because they are either synonymous or irrelevant. Being silent and sitting silently are both verb phrases that mean the same thing as keeping quiet, and they do not indicate a change or a decision. Magazine is a noun that refers to a publication or a device, but it has nothing to do with the women's issue or conversation.

It was a what?, countryside, anthology, dull read state park and identify the most likely answer to the question 'surface of earth'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","10. The most likely answer to the question 'There was a show on television about a ranger who loved flowers, but the next day it was about a gardener who also loved flowers.  It was a what?' is **(B) anthology**. This is because an anthology is a collection of stories that have a common theme or topic, but different characters or settings. A show that features different people who love flowers in each episode could be an example of an anthology. The other options are not types of shows, or that have anything to do with flowers or rangers or gardeners (countryside, dull read, state park, surface of earth)."

Compare the options There was a sign telling picnickers not to feed squirrels, where was this sign likely placed?, park, forest, tree roof and identify the most likely answer to the question 'yard'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) park**. This is because picnickers are people who eat outdoors, usually in a park or a forest. A sign telling them not to feed squirrels would be placed where squirrels are common and where people might be tempted to feed them. A park is a more likely place for this than a forest, because a forest is less accessible and less populated by humans. A tree, a roof, and a yard are not places where picnickers usually go, and they are not likely to have signs about squirrels.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) city**. This is because condos are a type of housing that are usually found in urban areas, where space is limited and expensive. A surplus of condos means that there are more condos than people who want to buy or rent them, which could happen due to overbuilding or a decline in demand. A central park, a vacation spot, and a suburbia are not likely to have a surplus of condos, because they are either not suitable for building condos or have less competition for space. Milwaukee is a specific city, not a general location.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) study for subject**. This is because a test is an assessment of a person's knowledge or skills in a particular subject, such as math, history, or science. To prepare for a test, the guy would need to review the material and practice the questions related to the subject. Practice, school grade, and homework are not specific enough to answer the question, because they could apply to any subject or activity. Ignore is not a good answer, because it means to pay no attention or disregard something, which would not help the guy do well on the test.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) new jersey**. This is because Hoboke is a city in the state of New Jersey, which is located in the northeastern region of the United States. A toll road is a road that charges a fee for using it, usually to pay for its maintenance or construction. Toll roads are common in New Jersey, especially near urban areas and bridges. Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New England are also in the northeastern region, but they are not the exact location of Hoboke. West United States is too vague and too far from Hoboke.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) theater**. This is because a theater is a place where people go to watch a performance, such as a play, a movie, or a musical. A premiere night is a special event where a new or important performance is shown for the first time, usually with a lot of publicity and excitement. An attendant is a person who works at a place and provides a service, such as checking tickets, showing seats, or keeping order. An attendant at the door would keep light from coming in during the show, because light can distract the audience and the performers. A building, an office, a neighbor's house, and a funeral are not likely places for a premiere night or a show, and they are not likely to have attendants at the door.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","6. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) ask**. This is because an email is a message sent electronically from one person or group to another, usually through the internet. A reply is a response or an answer to a message, usually sent back to the original sender. A follow up email is a second or subsequent email that is sent to remind, clarify, or update something from the first email. The purpose of a follow up email is usually to ask for a reply, especially if the first email was not answered or was not clear. Ignore, forward, obesity, and silence are not relevant to the question, because they do not explain the purpose of a follow up email.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question is **(B) sears**. This is because Sears is a department store that sells a variety of products, such as clothing, appliances, furniture, and electronics. Sears could be considered a place that really had a shop for everything, because it offers a wide range of items and services to customers. A school, an arena, and a mall are not places that specialize in sports equipment, and they are not places that have a shop for everything. A grocery is a place that sells food and other household items, but it does not specialize in sports equipment or have a shop for everything.

Where might he be?, motel, school, hotel apartment and identify the most likely answer to the question 'friend's house'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) apartment**. This is because an apartment is a type of housing that consists of one or more rooms in a building, usually rented by one person or a small group of people. An apartment could have only one room, which would serve as a living room, a bedroom, a kitchen, and a dining area. An apartment could also have a bed, a fridge, a stove, a couch, and a television, which are common household items. A motel, a school, a hotel, and a friend's house are not likely to have only one room, and they are not places where Bill would sleep regularly.

","9. The most likely answer to the question is **(D) crime scene**. This is because a crime scene is a place where a crime, such as a murder, a robbery, or a assault, has occurred or is suspected to have occurred. A crime scene could have shattered glass, blood, and a gun, which are evidence of violence or damage. A detective is a person who investigates crimes and gathers clues, and a cop is a person who enforces the law and arrests criminals. A detective would tell a cop to tape off the perimeter of the crime scene, which means to mark the boundaries of the area with tape, to prevent anyone from entering or tampering with the evidence. An army base, a police station, a police car, and a military base are not likely places for a crime scene, and they are not likely to have shattered glass, blood, and a gun.

","10. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) object**. This is because an object is anything that has a shape, a size, and a position, and that can be seen, touched, or measured. A geometry teacher is a person who teaches geometry, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, angles, and dimensions. A geometry teacher would explain how to find the area of the surface for each object, which means to calculate the amount of space that the surface of the object covers. A turtle, a tetrahedron, a lake, and a geometry problem are not general enough to answer the question, because they are specific examples of objects, not categories of objects."
