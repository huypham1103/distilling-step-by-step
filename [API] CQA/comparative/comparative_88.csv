A cellar is a similar term to a basement, but it may not have windows or doors that open to the outside, and it may be used for storing food or wine. A kitchen is a part of a house that is used for cooking and eating, but it may not be as prone to flooding as a basement either.

","3. The most likely answer to the question 'Where should a small dog sleep if they have trouble peeing indoors?' is **(E) basket**. This is because a basket can provide a small dog with a cozy and secure place to sleep, and can also be lined with absorbent materials to prevent urine from leaking or staining. Water is not a suitable place for a dog to sleep, as it can cause drowning, hypothermia, or infection. A kenne (which is a misspelling of kennel) may not be comfortable or familiar for a dog, and may also have other dogs that could stress or harm it. An aspca (which stands for American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) is an organization that helps animals in need, but is not a place for a dog to sleep. A person's home may be a good option, but it depends on whether the person is willing and able to care for the dog and its peeing problem.
