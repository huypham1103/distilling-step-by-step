","2. The most likely answer to the question ""Where would a human need to check how much oxygen he or she has?"" is **(B) underwater**. Underwater is a place where humans cannot breathe normally and need to use special equipment, such as scuba diving gear, to supply oxygen. Underwater, humans need to check how much oxygen they have left in their tanks or regulators to avoid running out of air and risking drowning or decompression sickness. Underwater is better than the other choices because:
    - (A) A space shuttle is a vehicle that transports humans and cargo to and from outer space. A space shuttle has a life support system that provides oxygen and other necessities for the crew and passengers. A space shuttle also has monitors and alarms that indicate the oxygen level and alert the crew in case of any problems. Therefore, humans do not need to check how much oxygen they have manually in a space shuttle.
    - (C) Civilisation is not a place, but a concept that refers to the complex social and cultural organisation of human societies. Civilisation is not a place where humans need to check how much oxygen they have, as humans can breathe normally in most civilised areas, unless there is some environmental or health issue that affects the air quality or the respiratory system.
    - (D) A spacecraft is a general term for any vehicle that operates in outer space. A spacecraft may or may not have a life support system that provides oxygen for the crew and passengers, depending on the type and purpose of the spacecraft.

Therefore, humans may or may not need to check how much oxygen they have manually in a spacecraft, depending on the situation and the design of the spacecraft.

A graveyard is not a place where humans need to check how much oxygen they have, as humans do not usually stay in a graveyard for long periods of time or perform any activities that require a lot of oxygen.

","1. The most likely answer to the question ""Where would a marmot be unable to walk to another continent?"" is **(D) New Zealand**. A marmot is a type of rodent that lives in mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. South America, North America, and Europe are all connected by land, so a marmot could theoretically walk to another continent from there. A cage is not a continent, so it is not a valid answer.

","2. The most likely answer to the question ""Where would a marmot feel most confined?"" is **(B) petting zoo**. A marmot is a wild animal that prefers to live in burrows and rocky habitats. A wood pile could provide some shelter and hiding places for a marmot, but it is not its natural environment. A wilderness is a natural area where a marmot could find food and mates, so it would not feel confined there. A northern hemisphere is a geographic region that covers half of the Earth, so it is too broad to answer the question. A mountainous area is the typical habitat of a marmot, so it would feel comfortable there. A petting zoo is a place where domesticated animals are kept for people to touch and feed, which would be stressful and unnatural for a marmot, so it would feel most confined there.

An apartment is a private residence where a person could shut a door loudly without disturbing anyone. A neighbor's house is a place where a person could visit or stay, but they would not necessarily feel guilty for shutting a door loudly, unless they were specifically asked to be quiet. A wall is not a place, but a structure, so it is not a valid answer. A library is a place where people read and study, so shutting a door loudly could be rude, but not as much as in a theater.
