","1. The most likely answer to the question 'If a person is feeling sick, but has a project to finish, what should they do?' is **(E) stay in bed**. This is because staying in bed can help the person recover faster and avoid spreading the illness to others. The other options are not very relevant or helpful for the situation. Thanking god, feeling ashamed, or living happily do not address the problem of being sick or finishing the project. Working at home might be an option, but it could also worsen the person's condition and affect the quality of their work.

This is because a court room is a place where a person who has committed a crime might face legal consequences and try to avoid them by lying, pleading, or bargaining. The other options are not very plausible or relevant for the situation. Cherry tree, chicken coop, or natural history museum are not places where a person would normally be tried or punished for a crime. Jail is a place where a person might end up if they fail to weasel out of punishment, not where they would try to do so.

This is because happy is the simplest and most direct antonym of unhappy, meaning the state of being satisfied, content, or joyful. The other options are not very precise or consistent for the situation. Joyful, exuberant, and glad are synonyms of happy, but they are not opposites of unhappy, as they imply different degrees or expressions of happiness.

Airport, heaven, or flight school are places where a person might see airplanes, but not necessarily wings on a helmet. Detroit is a city that has no obvious connection to wings or helmets.

The other options are not very typical or reasonable for the situation. Crossing street, running away, or washing themselves are not things that a person would generally wonder, but actions that they might or might not take depending on the circumstances.

    - (A) gain weight: This may or may not happen depending on the person's diet and activity level.
    - (B) walk away: This implies that the person quits their job, which is not a common outcome of spending all day at work.
    - (C) work hard: This is a possible answer, but not the most likely one, as working hard does not necessarily mean working all day.

","10. The most likely answer to the question ""If a person wants to sort a pile of stuff, they must start by what?"" is **(E) separate things**. This is because separating things is the first step of sorting, as it involves dividing the pile of stuff into smaller groups based on some criteria, such as size, color, type, etc. The other options are less likely because:
    - (A) control computer: This is irrelevant and unrelated, as it has nothing to do with sorting a pile of stuff.
    - (B) go on vacation: This is also irrelevant and unrelated, as it has nothing to do with sorting a pile of stuff.
