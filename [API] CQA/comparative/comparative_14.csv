He didn't enjoy television much but had no one to interact with, so he'd spend his free time doing what?, Choices: (A) watch film, (B) play cards, (C) surf net, (D) talking on the phone, (E) see favorite show.

He didn't enjoy television much but had no one to interact with, so he'd spend his free time doing what?, watch film, play cards, surf net talking on the phone and identify the most likely answer to the question 'see favorite show'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question 'see favorite show' is **(C) surf net**. This is because John didn't enjoy television much, so he would not watch a film or a show on TV. He also had no one to interact with, so he would not play cards or talk on the phone. Surfing the net is a possible activity that he could do alone and without a TV.

She faced a lot of what?, Choices: (A) ignoring, (B) being rude, (C) disparagement, (D) contumely, (E) uncertainty. Compare the options John had a lot of respect for Jill, but not many other people did.  She faced a lot of what?, ignoring, being rude, disparagement contumely and identify the most likely answer to the question 'uncertainty'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question 'uncertainty' is **(D) contumely**. This is because contumely means harsh or insulting language or treatment. If John had a lot of respect for Jill, but not many other people did, she would likely face a lot of contumely from others. Ignoring, being rude, and disparagement are also possible options, but they are less severe than contumely. Uncertainty is not relevant to the question.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","3. The most likely answer to the question 'handbag' is **(C) office supply store**. This is because John lost his appointment book somewhere and he doesn't want to bother looking for it. He would need to buy a new one, and the most likely place to find one is an office supply store. His house, pocket, and doctor's office are not places where he can get a new appointment book. A handbag is not a place, but an object.

Not breaking line was just what?, agitation, common sense, civil fatigue and identify the most likely answer to the question 'longer lines'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","4. The most likely answer to the question 'longer lines' is **(C) civil**. This is because civil means courteous and polite. John hated getting in line, but he did it anyway. Not breaking line was just a civil thing to do, as it shows respect for others. Agitation, common sense, and fatigue are not relevant to the question. Longer lines is not an adjective, but a noun phrase.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question 'help flowers pollenate' is **(B) buzz**. This is because John hated mosquitoes for the noise they made, not for the bloodsucking. The noise that mosquitoes make is a buzzing sound. Fly, move, and honey are not relevant to the question. Help flowers pollenate is not a sound, but an action.

","6. The most likely answer to the question 'closed room' is **(A) sky**. This is because John heard a language that he could not understand, which suggests that he was in a foreign place. He thought that the door was shut, but there was no door, which implies that he was outside. The light source that was blinding his eyes was very familiar, which indicates that it was the sun. He was on his back looking at the sky. Lamp, hallway, and dard are not relevant to the question. A closed room is not a place where he could see the sun.

Where did he live?, upstream, roof, aloft upstairs and identify the most likely answer to the question 'upwards'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","7. The most likely answer to the question 'upwards' is **(D) upstairs**. This is because John heard loud noise coming from below him, which means that he lived above the source of the noise. It always happened this time of day, which suggests that it was a regular occurrence. He really hated living here, which implies that he was unhappy with his situation. He lived upstairs, probably in an apartment building with noisy neighbors. Upstream, roof, and aloft are not relevant to the question. Upwards is not a place, but a direction.

Where might he be?, surface of earth, sink, medium ocean and identify the most likely answer to the question 'puddle'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","8. The most likely answer to the question 'puddle' is **(D) ocean**. This is because John was surrounded by water, with no land in sight. He was going from Britain to America, when his vessel went down, which means that he was in a transatlantic voyage. He might be in the ocean, either floating or drowning. Surface of earth, sink, and medium are not relevant to the question. A puddle is not a large body of water, but a small one.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","9. The most likely answer to the question 'war' is **(E) war**. This is because John joined the army because he wanted to see the world, but when the fighting started, he only saw the horrors of war. War is a state of armed conflict between countries or groups. Fort, orphans, and battlefield are possible things that he could see during a war, but they are not the same as war itself. Other countries is not relevant to the question.

","10. The most likely answer to the question 'prison' is **(C) labyrinth**. This is because John kept his right hand on the wall, knowing that it was the simplest way to keep from backtracking. This is a common strategy to solve a maze or a labyrinth, which is a complex network of paths or passages. John was in a labyrinth, probably trying to find his way out. Corner, art show, and classroom are not relevant to the question. A prison is not a place where he would need to keep his right hand on the wall, but a place where he would be locked up."

He went out and looked for it in what?, closet, basement, post office water and identify the most likely answer to the question 'garage'. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) garage**. This is because a garage is a common place to store boxes for long term storage, especially if they are not needed frequently. A closet, a basement, or a post office are also possible places to store boxes, but they are less likely than a garage. A water is not a place to store boxes at all, as they would get wet and damaged.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","2. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) tropics**. This is because anacondas are large snakes that live in tropical regions of South America and Africa, where they can find warm and humid habitats. A nightmare, a wyoming, or a ditch are not regions where anacondas live, but rather subjective or irrelevant terms. A pet shop is also not a region, but a place where some animals are sold, and it is unlikely that anacondas would be sold there.

","3. The most likely answer to the question is **(B) movie**. This is because a movie is something that John can see if he likes Disney films and there is nothing good on. A disneyland, a drawer, or a cabinet are not things that John can see, but rather places or objects that he can visit or use. A microwave is also not something that John can see, but a device that he can use to heat food.

","4. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) mexico**. This is because Mexico is the country that borders Texas to the south, and John would end up there if he takes the highway south and does not stop. Oklahoma, developed land, or united states are not places that John would end up next, as they are north or east of Texas. A desert is not a specific place, but a type of landscape that can be found in different places.

Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","5. The most likely answer to the question is **(B) rural area**. This is because a rural area is a term that describes an area that is not urbanized, and has low population density and few services. John lives in a farmhouse well away from anyone, which implies that he lives in a rural area. A farming community, a cow's shed, or a michigan are not terms that describe an area, but rather a group of people, a structure, or a state. A housing farmer and family is not a term at all, but a phrase that does not make sense.

","7. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) pet store**. This is because a pet store is a place where animals are sold, and John might avoid going there if he hates animal abuse, as he might think that the animals are mistreated or exploited. A parking lot, a woodland, or a park are places where John might not avoid going, as they do not involve animal abuse.

Still, he would have preferred it if the job were closer to his family, so he could visit them more often. A present, a stay here, or a come here are not terms that describe the location of a job, but rather the time or the direction of a movement. An available is also not a term that describes the location of a job, but rather the status of a job.

","9. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) surface of earth**. This is because the surface of earth is what a map usually represents, and water covers more than half of the surface of earth, in fact.

An ocean is also not something that a map represents, but a large body of water that covers part of the surface of earth.

A careful, a thoughtful, or a complete are also terms that describe the quality of an examination, but they are less specific than thorough. An intricate is not a term that describes the quality of an examination, but rather the complexity of something."

","3. The most likely answer to the question ""John was a terrible writer.   To practice, his teacher suggest that he consider people he knows and do what?"" is **(C) write letter**. This is because writing letters is a common and effective way to practice writing skills, as it involves expressing one's thoughts, feelings, and opinions to a specific audience. Writing letters also helps to improve grammar, vocabulary, and spelling. Writing novels, working in an advertising firm, or writing notes are not as suitable for practicing writing skills, as they require more creativity, experience, or brevity than writing letters. Writing poems is also a creative form of writing, but it may not be helpful for a terrible writer, as it involves using figurative language, rhyme, and rhythm, which may be challenging for a beginner.

","5. The most likely answer to the question ""John was cleaning out the old house.  while there was nothing upstairs, he found a bunch of old stuff somewhere else.  Where did he find stuff?"" is **(D) cellar**. This is because a cellar is a room or space below the ground level of a house, where people often store old or unused items, such as furniture, clothes, books, or tools. A loft or an attic are also possible places where old stuff can be found, but they are located above the ground level of a house, which contradicts the question.

","8. The most likely answer to the question ""John was going bathing in a public hot spring in japan, but he was embarrassed. What wasn't he comfortable with?"" is **(E) nudity**. This is because nudity is the state of being naked or without clothes, which is a common practice in public hot springs or onsens in Japan. However, some people may feel embarrassed or uncomfortable with exposing their bodies to strangers or people of the opposite sex, especially if they come from a different culture or background.

","9. The most likely answer to the question ""John was good at singing, usually.  But today he couldn't do it.  Why can't John sing?"" is **(A) hoarse voice**. This is because a hoarse voice is a voice that sounds rough, raspy, or weak, due to inflammation, irritation, or infection of the vocal cords. A hoarse voice can impair one's ability to sing, as it affects the pitch, tone, and volume of the voice. The other choices are not as likely to prevent John from singing, as they imply different factors that may affect his mood, motivation, or confidence, but not his vocal quality, such as change in mood, relaxation, feminine voice, or being heard.

He thought that there was too much what?"" is **(B) pollution**. This is because pollution is the presence or introduction of harmful or unwanted substances into the environment, such as air, water, or noise pollution.

A big city with many roads and a lot of traffic is likely to have a high level of pollution, which John may not like.

","1. The most likely answer to the question is **(E) getting hurt**. This is because a concussion is a type of head injury that can cause serious complications, such as brain damage, coma, or death. Therefore, John would be more scared of the possible consequences of his sport than just getting hurt, which is a less severe outcome. The other options are not relevant or logical. Head injuries are more scary than concussions, having fun is not something to be scared of, being sick is not directly related to playing football, and death is an extreme consequence that is unlikely to happen from a concussion.

","3. The most likely answer to the question is **(C) fidelity**. This is because fidelity means the quality of being faithful or loyal, and it is often used to describe the sound quality of a sound system. John would expect his sound system to have high fidelity, meaning that it reproduces the original sound accurately and clearly. The other options are not appropriate or related to the context.

","4. The most likely answer to the question is **(A) closet**. This is because a closet is a common place where people store their shirts and other clothes. John would pull open the closet door to look for a shirt. The other options are not as likely or reasonable. A chest is a large box that is usually used for storing valuables, not shirts. A drawer is a sliding compartment that is usually part of a dresser, not a separate item. A dresser is a piece of furniture that has drawers for storing clothes, but it is not something that can be pulled open.

A restaurant is a place where people can go to eat, but it might not be open late at night or serve alcohol.
