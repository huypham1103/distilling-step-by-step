If one needs a toothbrush and some food, they would likely go to a grocery store where they can find both items in one place. Going to a drug store, a dentist office, or the attic might be possible, but they are less likely and less convenient than going to a grocery store. Going to the mouth does not make sense, as it is not a place where one can buy anything. This is based on historical and practical evidence that shows how grocery stores are common and useful places where people can shop for their daily needs.

A membrane that protects the cell is the **cell membrane**, which is the outer layer of the cell that controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cell membrane is made of a phospholipid bilayer that has proteins and carbohydrates embedded in it. A historical example of a membrane that can be observed through magnification and protects the cell is the **plasma membrane**, which was first seen by **Ernst Ruska** and **Max Knoll** in 1931.
