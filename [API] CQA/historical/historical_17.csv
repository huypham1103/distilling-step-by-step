8. The most likely answer is **(A) wherever**. Wherever means in or to whatever place or situation. If one's husband is used to one's choosing the place to have dinner, he may not have a strong preference or opinion, and may just reply with wherever, meaning that he does not mind where they go.

This is a common consequence of drinking too much alcohol, which can irritate the stomach lining and cause nausea.

Recur, cause irrational behaviour, and cause hallucination are all negative effects of mental illness that she would want to avoid.

This is a common way of expressing acceptance and diversity, by acknowledging that everyone has their own unique characteristics, preferences, or abilities. The other options are not as likely because they do not convey the same message of tolerance and respect. Afraid of and part old are both negative or derogatory words that imply fear or ageism.
