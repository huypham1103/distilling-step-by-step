Studies have shown that eating breakfast can improve cognitive performance, memory, mood, and overall well-being. Dirty dishes, gain energy, bad breath, and gas are possible consequences of eating breakfast, but they are not the main benefit or purpose of doing so.

Walking away is a common way of physically indicating that a social interaction is over, and it allows both parties to resume their own activities or plans. Thank god, turn around, work hard, and explode are not typical or appropriate responses to ending a visit with someone, unless there are some special circumstances or emotions involved. Historically, walking away has been a natural and polite way of ending a visit, and it is often accompanied by verbal expressions of gratitude, farewell, or invitation for future contact.

A refrigerator, a bakery, a birthday party, and a trash are not suitable places to put an unbaked cake, as they will not cook it properly or at all. Historically, ovens have been used for baking cakes and other foods since ancient times, and they have developed from simple fire pits to modern electric or gas appliances.

","6. The most likely answer is **(E) fill with tears**.

Filling with tears is a natural and involuntary response to pain, irritation, or emotion, and it helps to lubricate and protect the eyes. Being punched in the nose can cause pain, inflammation, bleeding, or even fracture, which can trigger the tear glands to produce more tears than usual. See work, glass over, see light, and dry out are not likely outcomes of being punched in the nose, although they may have other causes or meanings. Historically, tears have been a part of human physiology and psychology for as long as humans have existed, and they have various functions and interpretations in different cultures and contexts.

An electrical circuit, getting married, a capital city, and Michigan are not likely locations for a courthouse, as they are either irrelevant, too specific, or too broad.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","3. The most likely answer is **(B) remote**. Living in a remote area means living far away from urban centers, where most of the local news sources are located. It can be hard for people who live in remote areas to get news that is relevant to their community, as they may not have access to newspapers, radio, television, or internet that cover their local issues and events.

Aeroplane is a synonym of airplane, but it is less commonly used in American English. Boat, ship's hold, and ferry are slower and less reliable modes of transportation, as they depend on water routes and weather conditions.
