- Historically, many cultures and societies have valued success and achievement as indicators of one's worth and status, and have stigmatized or punished failure and mistakes.
- Therefore, the student who failed might have felt that he no longer deserved respect, recognition, or happiness, and that he was inferior or inadequate compared to others.

Playing games is a common way to do that, especially in the past when there were fewer distractions and entertainment options for children. Riding horses, watching TV, and singing a song are less likely to be done by all the children in a classroom setting.
