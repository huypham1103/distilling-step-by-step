Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","1. The most likely answer is **(A) intelligent**. A smart design idea implies that the contestant was clever and creative, and that would catch the judges' attention.

","2. The most likely answer is **(A) airport**. The convenience was unparalleled means that the traveler had a very easy and comfortable journey, which is usually associated with flying by airplane. The traveler was waiting for the landing, which also implies that they were on an airplane. The other options are not related to the convenience or the landing. Restaurant, change planes, apartment building, and stairwell are all places that the traveler could go after landing, but not before.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","3. The most likely answer is **(C) unravel**. The cord had many a twist means that the cord was tangled or coiled, and the person holding it wanted to undo that. Unravel means to undo or separate something that is twisted or knotted. Straighten, bend, and flat are also possible actions, but they do not imply that the cord was twisted or that the person wanted to untwist it. And shout is not an action that is related to the cord at all. There is no historical context for this question, as cords have been used for various purposes throughout history.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","4. The most likely answer is **(E) town**. The corner shop was the epicenter of activity means that the shop was a central and busy place, where people gathered and socialized. This is more likely to happen in a small town, where everyone knows each other and there are not many other places to go. England and Iowa are not specific enough, as they are large regions that could have many different types of places. Street corner and city are also possible places, but they are not as likely to have a corner shop that is the epicenter of activity, as there would be more competition and diversity. There is some historical context for this question, as corner shops were more common and popular in the past, before the rise of supermarkets and online shopping.

The couple had a forgiving attitude with each other thereafter means that the couple had a conflict or a disagreement, but they decided to forgive each other and move on. What did they do means that the couple performed an action that showed their forgiveness and reconciliation. Make up is an action that means to end a quarrel or a dispute, and it often involves expressing affection or apologizing. Great relief, feel better, and respect are not actions, but feelings or attitudes that the couple could have after making up. Go up high is not an action that is related to forgiveness or reconciliation at all.

9. The most likely answer is **(C) babies**. The couple had been copulating seemingly non stop means that the couple had been having sexual intercourse very frequently and continuously. Eventually they finally had a what means that the couple achieved or obtained something as a result of their copulation. Babies are the most likely result of copulation, as they are the biological offspring of the couple. Intense pleasure and period of rest are possible outcomes of copulation, but they are not something that the couple had, but rather something that they felt or did. Conversation and skin irritation are also possible outcomes of copulation, but they are not very likely or desirable, and they do not imply that the couple achieved or obtained something. There is some historical context for this question, as copulation and reproduction have been essential aspects of human life and evolution throughout history.

2. The most likely answer is **(C) concert**. A concert is a musical performance where a band or an artist plays live for an audience. If the electricity went out, the band would not be able to use their instruments, amplifiers, microphones, or speakers, and the audience would not be able to see or hear them. A building, a bedroom, an opera, or a church are not things that are being attempted, but places where a concert could take place.

8. The most likely answer is **(E) to get food**. To get food is a phrase that means to obtain or receive something edible or nutritious. An elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier, because it was part of an experiment or a test to measure its memory and intelligence. Elephants are known to have excellent memory and cognitive skills, and they can remember things such as faces, places, routes, or events for a long time. To get food is the most likely reason why an elephant was asked to recall a number, because it was probably offered a reward or an incentive for giving the correct answer. Breathe, experience sadness, forget nothing, or remember everything are not reasons why an elephant was asked to recall a number, because they are either functions, feelings, or facts that are not related to the number or the question.

9. The most likely answer is **(E) sweet**. Sweet is a word that means pleasing, kind, gentle, or affectionate. Elephants are large, social, and intelligent animals that have a lot of personality and emotion. They can form strong bonds with their family members and friends, and they can express joy, grief, anger, or compassion. The younger ones are quite playful and sweet, because they like to have fun, explore, learn, and interact with their elders and peers. They can also be very affectionate and gentle, and they can show their love and care by touching, hugging, or kissing with their trunks. Cute, large, very big, or clear tree trunks away are not words that describe the personality of the younger elephants, because they are either physical, size, or action words that are not related to their character or behavior.

It could be a speech, a debate, a recital, a play, or a musical. An eloquent performance was stunning, because it impressed, moved, or captivated the audience with its skill, style, or message. It left everybody astounded, because they were surprised, amazed, or awed by the quality, the delivery, or the impact of the performance.

","6. The most likely answer is **(C) person**. A person is a living being that can act as a host, which means to welcome or entertain guests.
