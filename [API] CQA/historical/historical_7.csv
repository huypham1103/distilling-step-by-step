Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","1. The most likely answer is **(C) serve customers**. Waiting tables is a service-oriented job that involves interacting with customers, taking their orders, delivering their food, and collecting their payments. Tipping, washing hands, and going to the bathroom are not tasks that are specific to waiting tables, and serving food is only one part of the job.

Based on what is historically known, what is the most likely answer to the question 'Her flow was getting knotted, so she put up the convertible's top next time she was what?' with options stagnate, unmoved, stopping, hold up stagnant? Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","2. The most likely answer is **(C) stopping**. The word 'flow' in this context refers to the movement of air through the convertible's open top. When the car is moving, the air can cause the driver's hair to get knotted or tangled. Putting up the top can prevent this from happening, but it would only make sense to do so when the car is stopped, not when it is in motion. Stagnate, unmoved, hold up, and stagnant are not words that describe the car's state of motion.

Based on what is historically known, what is the most likely answer to the question 'Hers pets had fleas, not only did she have to treat them but the furniture and what too?' with options carpet, rug, roof, cat dog? Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","3. The most likely answer is **(A) carpet**. Fleas are small, wingless insects that feed on the blood of animals and humans. They can infest carpets, rugs, furniture, and bedding, and cause itching, allergic reactions, and diseases. Treating the pets and the furniture is not enough to get rid of fleas, as they can still hide and reproduce in the carpet. Roof, cat, and dog are not things that need to be treated for fleas, and rug is a synonym for carpet.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","4. The most likely answer is **(A) damage**. Drug addiction is a chronic disorder that affects the brain and behavior of the user. It can impair their judgment, decision-making, memory, and emotions. It can also cause problems in their relationships with family, friends, partners, and co-workers, as they may lie, steal, neglect, or abuse them. These problems can cause damage to the trust, respect, and love that are essential for healthy relationships. Cause accidents, cause illness, pain, and lower i.q. are not specific to relationships, and may not be the most severe consequences of drug addiction.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","5. The most likely answer is **(A) cool off**. Anger is a normal and healthy emotion, but it can become destructive if it is not managed properly. When anger reaches a boiling point, it means that the person is feeling extremely angry and may lose control of their actions or words. The therapist suggested that they should take a break and cool off, which means to calm down and reduce their anger. This can help them avoid saying or doing something that they might regret later. Fight, destroy enemy, illustrate point, and write letter are not ways to cool off, and may actually worsen the situation.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","6. The most likely answer is **(D) full**. The word 'bare' in this context means 'uncovered' or 'exposed'. His bare arms were flexing, which means that his muscles were contracting and relaxing, as he carried the wood inside. The status of his grasp, which means his grip or hold, was full, which means that he was carrying a lot of wood or that his hands were full.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","7. The most likely answer is **(E) meeting**. His boss told him that he would be speaking to the group that afternoon, which means that he had to give a presentation, a speech, or a report to his colleagues or clients. He needed him to share his knowledge, which means that he had to provide information, insights, or expertise on a certain topic or project. The next meeting, which means a formal or informal gathering of people for a specific purpose, was the most likely occasion for him to do so.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","8. The most likely answer is **(A) earn money**. His cupboards were barren, which means that they were empty or had no food. He had to go to work, which means that he had to perform his job or occupation. He had to do this so he could earn money, which means that he could receive payment or income for his work. He needed money to buy food and fill his cupboards. Eat, take bus, make money, and sleep are not things that he had to do to go to work, but things that he could do after he earned money.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","9. The most likely answer is **(D) power down**. His day at the office was nearing an end, which means that he was almost done with his work or that it was close to the time to leave. He went to the start menu on his computer, which is a graphical user interface that allows access to various programs and settings. He did this to power down, which means to turn off or shut down his computer. This is a common thing to do at the end of the workday, as it can save energy and prevent damage to the computer. Run programs, play games, control model, and reason exists are not things that he would do at the end of his workday, or things that he would use the start menu for.

","10. The most likely answer is **(A) dining room**. His dryer was on the fritz, which means that it was not working properly or malfunctioning. It was not drying clothes all the way, which means that it was leaving them wet or damp. He pointed an electric fan at his clothes, which is a device that creates a current of air by rotating blades. He did this after he hung them up in the dining room, which is a room where people eat meals. He did this to dry his clothes faster, as the fan would speed up the evaporation of water. Home, hardware store, closet, and computer are not places where he would hang his clothes, or places where he would have an electric fan."

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","1. The most likely answer is **(A) shopping mall**. A general store is a type of retail store that sells a variety of goods, such as groceries, clothing, hardware, etc. In the past, general stores were often located in rural areas or small towns, where they served as the main source of supplies for the local community. However, with the development of urbanization and transportation, general stores became less common and were replaced by more specialized stores or shopping malls. A shopping mall is a large building or complex that contains many different stores, services, and entertainment options. Shopping malls are usually found in urban areas or suburbs, where they attract customers from a wider area. Therefore, it is more likely that his favorite general store was conveniently located with other shops in a shopping mall than in a barn, salt, old west, or checkers.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","2. The most likely answer is **(D) movie**. A musical instrument is a device that produces sounds that can be used for music. There are many types of musical instruments, such as string instruments, wind instruments, percussion instruments, etc. Some musical instruments are played by individuals, while others are played by groups or bands. A band is a group of musicians who play musical instruments together, usually for a live audience. A soundtrack is a collection of music that accompanies a film, television show, video game, or other media. A soundtrack can be composed of original music, existing music, or a combination of both. Playing a musical instrument for the soundtrack of a movie can be considered a big break for a musician, as it can expose their talent and skill to a wider audience and increase their popularity and recognition. Therefore, it is more likely that his first big break wasn't with his band, but he played his musical instrument for the soundtrack of a movie than for a magazine, case, concert hall, or orchestra.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","3. The most likely answer is **(E) should not**. A friend is a person who has a close and mutual relationship with another person, based on affection, trust, support, etc. A friend can offer advice, help, comfort, or companionship to another friend. However, a friend can also influence another friend's decisions, actions, or behaviors, either positively or negatively. A conscience is a person's inner sense of right and wrong, morality, or ethics. A conscience can guide a person's choices, actions, or behaviors, based on their own values, principles, or beliefs. A conscience can also cause a person to feel guilt, remorse, or regret for doing something wrong or harmful. Therefore, it is more likely that his friend insisted that he must, but his conscience stopped him as he knew that he should not do something that was against his moral standards or that would cause negative consequences than that he was unnecessary, optional, will not, or need not do something.

Based on what is historically known, what is the most likely answer to the question 'His friends leg began to shake with nerves, he reached out and grasped it so it would what?' with options rattle, be still, nod, steady stay still? Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","4. The most likely answer is **(B) be still**. A leg is a part of the body that supports the weight and allows movement and locomotion. A leg consists of bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels, etc. A leg can also be used to express emotions, such as happiness, excitement, nervousness, etc. A leg can shake or tremble when a person is feeling nervous, anxious, scared, or stressed. This can be caused by a physical or psychological reaction to a situation, such as facing a challenge, danger, or uncertainty. A leg can also shake or tremble when a person is feeling cold, tired, or ill. This can be caused by a loss of body heat, energy, or health. To stop a leg from shaking or trembling, a person can try to calm down, relax, breathe deeply, or distract themselves from the source of their nervousness or anxiety. Alternatively, a person can try to warm up, rest, or seek medical attention if they are feeling cold, tired, or ill. Another option is to hold or grasp the leg firmly, so that it would be still or stop shaking or trembling. Therefore, it is more likely that his friend's leg began to shake with nerves, he reached out and grasped it so it would be still than that it would rattle, nod, steady, or stay still.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","5. The most likely answer is **(C) cut there**. Hair is a filamentous biomaterial that grows from the skin of mammals, especially on the head. Hair can have different colors, textures, lengths, styles, etc. Hair can also be used to express one's personality, identity, culture, or fashion. Hair can be modified by various methods, such as combing, coloring, cutting, braiding, washing, etc. A ponytail is a hairstyle in which the hair is pulled back and tied together at the back of the head, leaving the rest of the hair hanging freely. A ponytail can be worn by both men and women, and can be high, low, or side. A ponytail can be a simple, practical, or casual hairstyle, or it can be a stylish, elegant, or formal hairstyle. To make a ponytail, the hair needs to be long enough to be gathered and tied together. If the hair is not long enough, it can be difficult or impossible to make a ponytail. Therefore, it is more likely that his hair was getting long enough that it could be put in a ponytail, so he headed to this place to have it cut there than to have it combed when not straight, colored, braided, or washed. This place could be a barber shop, a hair salon, or a similar establishment that offers hair cutting services"
