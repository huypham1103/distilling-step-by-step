Arthritis, losing weight, exercising, and feeling better are not causes of sweating, but rather possible effects or reasons of sweating.

9. The most likely answer is **(B) asthma attacks**. Asthma is a chronic condition that affects the airways of the lungs, causing them to become inflamed, narrow, and produce excess mucus. Asthma attacks are episodes of severe breathing difficulty that can be triggered by various factors, such as allergens, pollutants, infections, or exercise.
