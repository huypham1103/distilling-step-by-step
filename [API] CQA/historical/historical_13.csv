She shouldn't have though, because it wasn't here place.  She was just visiting. Where might she be?' with options party, hotel, friend's house, office bedroom? Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","8. The correct answer is **(C) friend's house**. Friend's house is a noun phrase that means the residence of a person who is close or familiar to another person. A person who answers the telephone at a place that is not their own, and is just visiting, is likely to be at a friend's house, as this is a common situation for guests or visitors. Party, hotel, office, and bedroom are not likely places for someone to answer the phone and regret it, as they either refer to public, commercial, professional, or private settings.

And the manager wasn't very attentive to her needs, either.   Where might she be?' with options office, hospital, friend's house, hotel every u.s? Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","9. The correct answer is **(D) hotel**. Hotel is a noun that means a place that provides accommodation, meals, and other services for travelers or tourists. A person who has trouble using the phone because they have to dial 9 to get an outside line, and the manager is not attentive to their needs, is likely to be at a hotel, as this is a common feature and problem of hotel phones. Office, hospital, friend's house, and every u.s are not likely places for someone to have this issue, as they either refer to different types of phones, or are too broad or vague.

","10. The correct answer is **(B) music store**. Music store is a noun phrase that means a shop that sells musical instruments, accessories, and books. A person who is mastering a music scale, and wants to find books on the matter, is likely to go to a music store, as this is a place that has a variety of books on music theory and practice. Post office, assay office, butcher shop, and doctor's office are not likely places for someone to find books on music, as they either refer to different types of services, or are unrelated to music."

He never did drugs, never drank, but he was in his what?' with options fifties, geometry, polygon, four sides town center? Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","1. The most likely answer is **(A) fifties**. The phrase ""too old for this shit"" is a common expression of frustration or exhaustion, often used by people who are past their prime or feel out of place in a situation. The word ""square"" is a slang term for someone who is conventional, boring, or uncool, especially in contrast to someone who is rebellious, adventurous, or hip. The phrase ""never did drugs, never drank"" implies that Jerry was very straight-laced and abstained from substances that were popular among some youth cultures. These clues suggest that Jerry was in his fifties, which is an age when some people might feel too old or too square for certain activities or environments.

","2. The most likely answer is **(D) michigan**. Ann Arbor is a city in the state of Michigan, in the United States of America. It is the home of the University of Michigan, a prestigious public research university. A shopping complex is a large building or area that contains many shops, restaurants, and other businesses. A shopping complex in Ann Arbor would be located in a heavily developed area, but not necessarily in a big city or suburbia. Arizona is a different state, far away from Michigan, and has a very different climate and geography.

What might the cops do to him?' with options going to jail, going to prison, beat him up, get arrested die? Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","4. The most likely answer is **(D) get arrested**. Killing people is a serious crime, and the cops are the law enforcement officers who are responsible for catching and arresting criminals. If Jim enjoyed killing people, but he did it too often and the cops found out, the most likely outcome is that the cops would get him arrested and put him in jail or prison. Going to jail or prison are possible consequences of getting arrested, but not actions that the cops would do to him directly. Beating him up or killing him are possible actions that the cops might take, but they are not legal or ethical, and they are not the most likely outcomes.

Jim is applying for his first job, which means that he has never been employed before. He is nervous, which means that he is anxious or worried about something. He is not sure he is ready for employment, which means that he doubts his ability or suitability for working in a job. Sadness, less sleep, stress, and rejection are possible feelings or experiences that Jim might face in his job search or employment, but they are not what he is applying for or what he is not sure he is ready for.

He hit a car because he mistook forward for what?' with options reverse, unconventional, drive, ill tangential? Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","6. The most likely answer is **(A) reverse**. Jim is normal, which means that he is typical or ordinary. He ate bad sushi, which means that he consumed raw fish that was spoiled or contaminated. He made a terrible mistake, which means that he did something wrong or foolish. He hit a car, which means that he collided with another vehicle. He mistook forward for reverse, which means that he confused the direction of movement or the gear of his car. Forward is the direction that is in front of or ahead of someone or something.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","7. The most likely answer is **(B) constantly**. Jim never stopped talking, which means that he always spoke or communicated verbally. The rate at which he talked is the frequency or speed of his speech. Constantly is an adverb that means all the time or without interruption. It is a synonym of continually or always, and it is a suitable word to describe Jim's rate of talking. Always forever is a redundant phrase that means the same thing as always, but it is not a single word. All day is a phrase that means for the whole day, but it is not a word that describes a rate.

The stock market is a place where shares of companies are bought and sold, and where people can make or lose money by investing in different stocks. The stock market is something that Jim could try studying to make a fortune, without involving physical labor or dealing with people. A cookie is a baked good that is not likely to make Jim a fortune. Real estate is a business that involves buying and selling property, which requires physical labor and dealing with people. A treasure chest is a box that contains valuable items, but it is not something that Jim could study.
