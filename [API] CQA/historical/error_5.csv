A child who has never seen a jellyfish in real life might have only seen them in a tank, such as in an aquarium, a zoo, or a science museum. A tank is a container that holds water and aquatic life, and allows people to observe them. A child might also have seen jellyfish in a movie, but that is not as realistic as seeing them in a tank.
