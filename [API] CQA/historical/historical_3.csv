Office building, hotel, and school are not likely places where Bob would have a bedroom, as they are usually used for other purposes. Hotel is repeated twice in the choices, which is another mistake.

7. The most likely answer is **(E) candy shop**. Bobby had a toothache so he went to the closest dentist office, which was in a strange place. Where might it be? It might be in a candy shop, which is a strange place for a dentist office, as candy is often associated with causing tooth decay and cavities. A town, an office building, a patient, and a medical center are not strange places for a dentist office, as they are normal or expected locations. Historically, candy shops have been selling sweets and confections since the Middle Ages, but they became more popular and diverse in the 19th and 20th centuries with the development of mass production and new varieties of candy.

It was allergies, which are immune system reactions to certain substances that cause symptoms such as sneezing, itching, or rashes. Sneezing, exhaustion, and itchy are not diseases or conditions, but rather symptoms or effects. Cleanliness is not a cause of sickness, but rather a preventive measure. Historically, allergies have been recognized and studied since the 19th century, and they are influenced by genetic and environmental factors.
