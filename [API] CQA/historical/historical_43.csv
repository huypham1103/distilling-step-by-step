Provide historical context in your rationale.

Indoor cats tend to live longer than outdoor cats because they are protected from many dangers and diseases that outdoor cats face, such as predators, traffic, parasites, infections, and poisoning. Indoor cats also have more access to veterinary care, nutrition, and human companionship.

","1. The most likely answer is **(D) music store**. A clarinet is a musical instrument that belongs to the woodwind family. It is usually played by blowing air into a mouthpiece and pressing keys to produce different notes. A new student trying a clarinet would most likely do so in a music store, where they can buy or rent the instrument and get some guidance from the staff. A clarinet case is just a container for storing the instrument, not a place where it is played. A jazz band is a group of musicians that play jazz music, which often features clarinets, but a new student would not be able to join a jazz band without some prior experience and practice. Spongebob is a fictional character from a cartoon show, not a place where a clarinet is played.

","2. The most likely answer is **(C) thinking**. Aliens are hypothetical extraterrestrial beings that may or may not exist and may or may not communicate with humans. Some scientists have speculated that aliens could be communicating by using their minds, or telepathy, which is the ability to transmit and receive thoughts without using words or gestures. This would allow them to overcome the barriers of language, distance, and time that may hinder other forms of communication. Effort, farting, laughing, and medium are not plausible ways of communicating for aliens, as they either require physical actions, sounds, or intermediaries that may not be available or compatible with alien biology or technology.
