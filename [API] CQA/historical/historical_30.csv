Historically, laughter has been associated with joy, amusement, and relief, which are emotions that contrast with the grief and sadness of a funeral.

6. The most likely answer is **(A) electric mixer**. An electric mixer is a device that uses an electric motor to rotate a set of beaters or blades to mix, whisk, or beat ingredients. It can speed up the process of preparing food, such as making dough, batter, whipped cream, or meringue. Historically, electric mixers were invented in the late 19th century and became popular in the 20th century as a household appliance. The other options are either not powered by electric motors or not related to the task of mixing.

7. The most likely answer is **(E) british columbia**. British Columbia is a province in western Canada that has a diverse geography and climate, including mountains, forests, islands, and coastlines. It is home to a variety of wildlife, including bald eagles, which are large birds of prey that have a distinctive white head and tail. Bald eagles are native to North America and can be found in both the USA and Canada, especially near bodies of water where they can fish. Historically, bald eagles have been a symbol of strength, freedom, and majesty, and have been featured on the national emblem of the USA since 1782.

8. The most likely answer is **(C) favourite** or **(D) favorite**. If he believed in the underdog, he was rooting for the team or person that had a lower chance of winning, but the odds were not good enough, he decided to bet his money on the team or person that had a higher chance of winning, which is called the favourite or favorite. This is a rational choice that maximizes the expected value of his bet, but it may also indicate a lack of loyalty or confidence in the underdog. Historically, betting has been a form of gambling that involves predicting the outcome of an event and placing a wager on it.

9. The most likely answer is **(D) moving**.

","1. The most likely answer is **(E) big house**. A small dog that stays indoors would feel like it has more space in a bigger house than in a smaller apartment, a living room, or a basket.

4. The most likely answer to the question 'Tickling for a prolonged period of time can cause dizziness and with the spinning, what else can happen?' is **(D) nausea**. Vomiting is a possible consequence of nausea, but not a direct cause. Laughing and giggling are reactions to tickling, but not related to spinning. Itchiness is a sensation that can be caused by tickling, but not by spinning. Nausea is a feeling of sickness or discomfort in the stomach, which can be induced by both tickling and spinning. A scientific explanation for this is that both tickling and spinning stimulate the **vestibular system** in the inner ear, which is responsible for balance and motion perception.

Itchiness is a sensation that can be caused by tickling, but not by spinning. Nausea is a feeling of sickness or discomfort in the stomach, which can be induced by both tickling and spinning. A scientific explanation for this is that both tickling and spinning stimulate the **vestibular system** in the inner ear, which is responsible for balance and motion perception.

Planning ahead can involve researching the destination, booking tickets or accommodation, packing essentials, checking the weather, etc. A historical example of a problem that could have been avoided by planning ahead is the **Titanic disaster** of 1912, which was caused by a lack of lifeboats, safety drills, and iceberg warnings.

8. The most likely answer to the question 'To avoid tripping while moving through your home, where should you have a light source?' is **(E) hallway**.

A light source can be a lamp, a bulb, a candle, etc. A historical example of a hallway with a light source is the **Hall of Mirrors** in the Palace of Versailles, which has 17 windows and 350 mirrors that reflect natural and artificial light.

9. The most likely answer to the question 'To gain her trust the real estate agent was very polite, delightful and all around what?' is **(B) charming**.

A charming person can make others feel comfortable, interested, or impressed by their behavior or appearance. A historical example of a charming real estate agent is **Ryan Serhant**, who is a star of the reality TV show Million Dollar Listing New York and a successful broker in the city.
