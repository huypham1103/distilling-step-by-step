2. The most likely answer is **(E) conquer**. A general is a military leader who commands an army. If he suffered his first defeat, it means he lost a battle or a war for the first time. His opponent is the enemy general or army that he was fighting against. To conquer means to take control of a place or a people by force. This is the ultimate goal of most wars and battles. Therefore, it is logical to say that the great general's opponent could conquer anyone, meaning he was very powerful and successful in war. This could apply to many historical examples, such as Alexander the Great, Napoleon, or Genghis Khan.

3. The most likely answer is **(B) collaboration**. A group is a number of people who work together for a common purpose. Communication is the exchange of information or ideas between people. Quality work is work that meets or exceeds the standards or expectations of the task. Collaboration is the act of working with others to achieve a goal. Therefore, it makes sense to say that the group's quality work showed how well their collaboration went, meaning they cooperated effectively and efficiently. This could be true for many kinds of groups, such as teams, committees, or organizations.

4. The most likely answer is **(C) plate**. A guest is a person who is invited to visit someone's home or attend an event. A cookie is a small, flat, sweet baked good. To arrange means to put things in a particular order or position. To set out means to place something where it can be seen or used. A plate is a flat, round dish that is used to serve or eat food. Therefore, it makes sense to say that she carefully arranged the cookies and set them out on a plate, meaning she prepared the cookies for the guests to enjoy. This is a common courtesy and hospitality gesture in many cultures.

5. The most likely answer is **(D) dangerous**. A guide is a person who leads or shows the way to others, especially in a new or unfamiliar place. To be safe means to be protected from harm or risk. A section is a part or division of something larger. A bear is a large, furry animal with a short tail and sharp claws. To be dangerous means to be able or likely to cause harm or injury. Therefore, it makes sense to say that the guide told them to be very safe in this section, the bears in this area were very dangerous, meaning the bears posed a serious threat to the people and they had to be careful. This could be true for many places where bears live, such as forests, mountains, or national parks.

6. The most likely answer is **(B) holster**. A gun is a weapon that shoots bullets or projectiles. To tuck means to push, fold, or insert something into a small space. Pants are a piece of clothing that covers the lower part of the body from the waist to the ankles. To be uncomfortable means to cause physical or mental discomfort or pain. A holster is a device that holds a gun on a person's body, usually attached to a belt or a strap. Therefore, it makes sense to say that the gun was uncomfortable tucked in her pants, so she put it in a holster, meaning she moved the gun to a more suitable and convenient place. This could be true for many situations where a person needs to carry a gun, such as law enforcement, security, or self-defense.

7. The most likely answer is **(B) pain and suffering**. A hard working man is a man who works diligently and earnestly. To be stuck means to be unable to move or escape from a situation. A home is a place where one lives or stays. An injury is a wound or damage to a part of the body. To try means to make an effort or attempt to do something. To keep busy means to occupy oneself with tasks or activities. Housework is the work of cleaning and maintaining a house. To cause means to make something happen or exist. Pain is the sensation of physical or mental distress or discomfort. Suffering is the state of undergoing pain, hardship, or distress. Therefore, it makes sense to say that the hard working man was stuck at home after his injury, he tried to keep busy doing housework but it caused pain and suffering, meaning he worsened his condition by overexerting himself. This could be true for many cases where a person is injured and needs to rest and recover.

8. The most likely answer is **(B) slowly**. A hare is a fast-running animal that resembles a rabbit but has longer ears and legs. To travel means to move from one place to another. To be fast means to move or act quickly or at a high speed. To get cocky means to become overconfident or arrogant. A tortoise is a slow-moving animal that has a hard shell covering its body. To win means to be the best or most successful in a contest or competition. A race is a contest of speed between two or more competitors. To travel slowly means to move at a low speed or leisurely pace. Therefore, it makes sense to say that the hare traveled fast but got cocky, so though the tortoise traveled slowly it won the race, meaning the hare underestimated the tortoise and lost because of his pride and carelessness. This is a famous fable attributed to Aesop, a Greek storyteller.

9. The most likely answer is **(E) nap**. A hiker is a person who walks for a long distance, especially across country or in the mountains. To suffer means to experience or be subjected to something bad or unpleasant. Fatigue is extreme tiredness or exhaustion. A steep trail is a path or track that has a sharp or sudden slope or gradient. To decide means to make a choice or judgment about something. To stop means to cease moving or doing something. A nap is a short sleep, usually during the day. Therefore, it makes sense to say that the hikers were suffering from fatigue on the steep trail, they decided to stop and nap, meaning they needed to rest and recharge their energy. This could be true for many situations where a person is physically tired and needs a break.

A human is a member of the species Homo sapiens, characterized by intelligence, language, and culture. To have means to possess or hold something. A feeling is an emotion or a sensation.
