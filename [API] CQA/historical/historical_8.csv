","Rationale: A steel pen is a type of writing instrument that has a metal nib and uses ink. Steel pens were invented in the early 19th century and became popular in the mid-19th century. They were mass-produced and widely used until the advent of fountain pens and ballpoint pens in the 20th century. If someone had more than one steel pen, especially a large quantity like 100,000, they would need a spacious and secure place to store them. A warehouse is a large building that is used for storing goods and merchandise. A warehouse would be a suitable place to store a large number of steel pens, as it would provide enough space, protection, and accessibility. A hand, a tv stand, a back of farm, or a desk drawer would not be able to accommodate such a large number of steel pens."

","Rationale: Absolution is the act of formally releasing someone from guilt, blame, or punishment. Absolution is often associated with religious or legal contexts, where a person who has committed a sin or a crime can be forgiven by a higher authority, such as God or a judge.

If someone has a forgiving attitude toward another person, they are likely to grant them absolution, or free them from the burden of their mistake. Redemption, isolation, great relief, and feel better are possible outcomes or consequences of absolution, but they are not the same as the act of absolution itself."
