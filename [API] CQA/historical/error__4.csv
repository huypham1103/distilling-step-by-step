","930s, dance marathons were a popular form of entertainment and competition, where couples would dance for hours or days, often collapsing from exhaustion or injury.

8. The most likely answer is **(D) irritation**. Irritation is a feeling of annoyance, impatience, or anger, or the state of being inflamed or infected. This is a likely reaction of Bob and Boris, who were standing in a queue at the grocery store, and had to endure the loud noise of the children in front of them, which could disturb their peace or concentration. This is an emotional and physical response that has been expressed and treated throughout history. For example, in ancient Greece, irritation was one of the four humors or temperaments, which were believed to affect the health and personality of a person.

9. The most likely answer is **(B) open mouth**. Opening the mouth is a necessary action for talking, as it allows the air to pass through the vocal cords and produce sound. If Bob wants to talk, but he's surrounded by gnats and he thinks they're gross, he might refuse to open his mouth, as he might fear that the gnats would enter his mouth or bite his tongue. This is a logical and biological reason that has been understood and explained throughout history. For example, in the Bible, God told Moses to speak to Pharaoh and demand the release of the Israelites, but Moses said, ""I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue...I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."" God then said, ""Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord? Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.""

","10. The most likely answer is **(E) candy shop**. A candy shop is a place that sells sweets, chocolates, and other confections, which are often considered as treats or indulgences. This is a strange place for a dentist office, as candy can cause tooth decay and cavities, which are the opposite of what a dentist would want for their patients. This is an ironic and humorous situation that has been used and enjoyed throughout history. For example, in the movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Willy Wonka is a famous candy maker who invites five children to visit his factory, where he reveals that he is looking for an heir to his candy empire. One of the children is Mike Teavee, who loves watching television and hates reading books. He finds a golden ticket in a Wonka Bar, which he bought at a dentist office, where his father works as a dentist. His father says, ""I don't understand it. The boy went and bought a candy bar, and the next thing you know, he's got a golden ticket. I don't understand it."" Mike says, ""You don't understand anything, Pop. You don't understand the magic of television."" His father says, ""I understand one thing, son. I understand dentistry. And if you want to grow up to be a good dentist, you've got to give up this television nonsense."" Mike says, ""Who wants to be a good dentist? I want to be the first person in the world to be sent by television."" His father says, ""Sent by television? What are you talking about?"" Mike says, ""You'll see, Pop. You'll see.""
