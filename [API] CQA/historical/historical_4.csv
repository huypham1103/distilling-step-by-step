8. The most likely answer is **(C) higher interest rates**. Fighting inflation is always a topic in economics, but the soon to be homeowner had to worry about the higher interest rates. Inflation is the general increase in the prices of goods and services over time, which reduces the purchasing power of money. Economics is the social science that studies how people produce, distribute, and consume goods and services, and how they deal with scarcity, choice, and trade-offs. Interest rates are the amount of money that lenders charge borrowers for the use of their money, usually expressed as a percentage of the principal amount. Homeowners are people who own or are buying a house or an apartment, usually by taking out a mortgage, which is a loan secured by the property. Fighting inflation is often a goal of economic policy, as it can have negative effects on the economy and the society, such as reducing the value of savings, incomes, and investments, and increasing the cost of living, borrowing, and production. One of the common ways to fight inflation is to raise interest rates, which can reduce the demand for money and credit, and slow down the growth of spending and output. However, higher interest rates can also make it more difficult and expensive for homeowners to buy or refinance their properties, as they have to pay more interest on their mortgages.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","9. The most likely answer is **(D) rising interest rates**. Fighting inflation means being aware of many things, such as rising interest rates with loans. A loan is a sum of money that is borrowed and repaid with interest, usually for a specific purpose, such as buying a car, starting a business, or paying for education. As explained in the previous question, inflation is the general increase in the prices of goods and services over time, and one of the ways to fight it is to raise interest rates, which can reduce the demand for money and credit, and slow down the growth of spending and output. However, rising interest rates can also affect the borrowers and lenders of loans, as they can change the cost and availability of credit. For borrowers, rising interest rates can make it harder and more expensive to obtain or repay loans, as they have to pay more interest on their debt. For lenders, rising interest rates can make it more profitable and attractive to lend money, as they can earn more interest on their loans. However, they also have to consider the risk of default, which is the failure of the borrower to repay the loan, which can increase if the borrower faces financial difficulties due to higher interest rates.

","10. The most likely answer is **(E) eaten raw**. Fish comes in all varieties, many people prefer the ones that can be eaten raw. Fish are aquatic animals that have gills, fins, and scales, and are a source of food, recreation, and trade for humans. Fish can be prepared and consumed in various ways, such as cooked, smoked, dried, canned, or pickled. However, some people prefer to eat fish raw, which means without any heat or chemical treatment, such as frying, baking, boiling, or marinating. Eating raw fish can have some benefits, such as preserving the natural flavor, texture, and nutrients of the fish, and avoiding the formation of harmful substances that can occur during cooking. However, eating raw fish can also have some risks, such as exposing the consumer to parasites, bacteria, viruses, or toxins that can cause illness or poisoning. Therefore, eating raw fish requires careful selection, handling, and hygiene, and is not recommended for everyone, especially for pregnant women, children, elderly, or immunocompromised people. Some of the most popular types of fish that can be eaten raw are tuna, salmon, mackerel, sardines, anchovies, herring, and trout.
