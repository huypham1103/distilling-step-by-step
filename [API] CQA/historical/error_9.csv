John wanted to keep his food fresh, meaning he wanted to preserve its quality, taste, and appearance. He bought something that would let him suck the air out, leaving empty space inside, meaning he used a vacuum sealer or a similar device. This would keep food fresh, because it would reduce oxidation, spoilage, and freezer burn. This item was a type of baggie, because it was a plastic bag that could be sealed. A front, a jar, a box, and a universe are not types of baggies, and they are not suitable for storing food with a vacuum sealer.

John wanted to meet interesting people, meaning he wanted to interact with people who had different personalities, hobbies, or backgrounds. But he always drove them away, meaning he repelled them or made them leave. He felt that he needed to be more friendly, meaning he needed to improve his social skills, his attitude, or his behavior. Being friendly can help attract and retain interesting people, because it shows respect, interest, and openness. Understand themselves, socialize, take class, and explore are not terms that describe what John needed to be more, but rather actions that he could do to be more friendly."
