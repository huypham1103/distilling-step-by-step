Historically, people have been unable to talk to other people after getting drunk or consuming excessive amounts of alcohol, which is a psychoactive substance that affects the brain and the nervous system. Alcohol can impair speech, language, or communication, and can cause slurred speech, which is a condition where the words are unclear, distorted, or incomprehensible. Slurred speech can result from the loss of muscle control, coordination, or sensation in the mouth, tongue, or throat, and can also affect the volume, tone, or rhythm of the voice. Slurred speech can make it difficult or impossible to talk to other people, and can also indicate intoxication, poisoning, or overdose. For example, during the Prohibition era in the 1920s and 1930s, many people drank illegal or homemade alcohol, such as moonshine, bootleg, or bathtub gin, which often contained toxic or harmful ingredients, such as methanol, lead, or wood alcohol, and caused slurred speech, blindness, or death. Another example is during the binge drinking culture, a pattern of excessive or heavy drinking that started in the 1980s and 1990s, many people drink large amounts of alcohol in a short period of time, such as four or five drinks in two hours, and experience slurred speech, vomiting, blackouts, or alcohol poisoning.
