They were looking at a skeleton, which is the framework of bones that supports and protects the body of an animal or a human. The skeleton can reveal a lot of information about the anatomy, physiology, evolution, and health of an organism. This is a scientific field that has been studied and advanced by many physiologists, such as William Harvey, who discovered the circulation of blood, and Marie Curie, who discovered radioactivity.

","10. The most likely answer is **(A) baking soda**. The pioneer went to the general store for baking supplies, which means that they were a settler who moved to a new and undeveloped area, and they needed ingredients for making bread or cake. They were looking for baking soda, which is a white powder that is used as a leavening agent, which makes the dough rise and become fluffy. Baking soda was a common and useful item that pioneers used for cooking, cleaning, and medicine. This is a historical fact that has been recorded and preserved in many pioneer diaries, recipes, and memoirs, such as the Little House on the Prairie series by Laura Ingalls Wilder."

","1. The pioneer went to the general store for food preservation supplies, what was he looking for?

The most likely answer is **(D) salt**. Salt is a natural preservative that can prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi on food. Pioneers often used salt to cure meat, fish, cheese, and other foods that would otherwise spoil quickly. Salt was also used to make pickles, sauerkraut, and other fermented foods that could last for months or years. Barrels, checkers, baking soda, and water are not as effective or common as food preservation supplies.

The most likely answer is **(E) thin**. A thin pizza crust is usually crispy and can support a large amount of toppings. A thin crust is also easier to cut and eat than a thick or doughy crust. Skinny, slender, broadtail, and slim are not appropriate words to describe the thickness of a pizza crust.

","8. The plant suffered in the shade, where did it need to be planted instead?

The most likely answer is **(C) direct sunlight**. Direct sunlight is the light that comes directly from the sun, without being blocked or reflected by anything.

6. The most likely answer is **(B) city**. The roadway had fallen into disrepair, the citizens took their complaints to the **city**. This is because the city is the local government that is responsible for maintaining public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and sidewalks. A historical example of this is the **pothole problem** that affects many cities around the world, especially after harsh winters, which can cause damage to vehicles and increase the risk of accidents.
7. The most likely answer is **(C) subdivision**. The roadway passed a sign and gate house, what was behind the gatehouse? **Subdivision**.
