Hard work is the effort and dedication that one puts into achieving a goal or completing a task. Hard work is often seen as a virtue and a source of pride and satisfaction. A father who wants his son to succeed and be responsible would encourage him to work hard and not be lazy.
8. The most likely answer is **(D) tropical rainforest**. A ficus is a type of plant that belongs to the fig family. Ficus plants are native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where they grow in humid and warm climates. A ficus that grew vigorously would most likely get plenty of humidity and weather in a tropical rainforest, which is a biome that has high rainfall and biodiversity. A tropical rainforest provides a suitable environment for a ficus to thrive and flourish.
9. The most likely answer is **(A) dying**. A fight enemy choice that had led to a grave injury would most likely result in dying. Dying is the process of ceasing to live or losing vital functions. A grave injury is a serious or life-threatening wound or damage that can impair one's health or survival. A fight enemy choice is a decision to engage in combat or conflict with an opponent or adversary. A fight enemy choice that had led to a grave injury would most likely cause severe blood loss, organ failure, infection, or shock, which could lead to dying.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","4. The most likely answer is **(C) cupboard**. A cupboard is a common place to store flour, as it is dry, cool, and out of reach for children. Flour is a powdery substance that can make a mess if children play with it. A pantry, a grocery store, or a kitchen are also possible places to store flour, but they are less specific than a cupboard. A table is not a good place to store flour, as it is exposed and accessible.

9. The most likely answer is **(B) slowly**. This question is based on a famous fable attributed to Aesop, a Greek storyteller who lived in the 6th century BC. The fable tells the story of a race between a hare, a fast and confident animal, and a tortoise, a slow and steady animal. The hare traveled fast but got cocky, meaning that he was overconfident and arrogant, and he decided to take a nap during the race. The tortoise traveled slowly, meaning that he moved at a slow but consistent pace, and he passed the sleeping hare and won the race. The moral of the fable is that slow and steady wins the race, or that perseverance and patience are more important than speed and talent.

Feelings are emotions or sensations that are experienced by a person, such as happiness, sadness, anger, or fear. Feelings can also refer to the affection or attraction that one has for another person.

A cafe is a small restaurant that serves coffee, tea, and light meals or snacks. A conventional approach is a way of doing something that is normal, standard, or customary, and that follows the established rules, norms, or expectations. A hipster might try to take a disingenuous kooky approach to their cafe, by pretending to be original, creative, or innovative, and by offering unusual or exotic products or services, but they might fail to attract or satisfy customers, who prefer a more reliable, familiar, or quality experience. A competitor who takes a conventional approach to their cafe, by providing basic, simple, or classic products or services, and by meeting the needs and preferences of customers, might have more success and profitability. Historically, the term hipster originated in the 1940s and 1950s, to describe the fans and followers of jazz music, and it was revived in the 1990s and 2000s, to describe the young urban professionals who embraced indie culture and alternative media.

The big apple is a nickname for New York City, the largest and most populous city in the United States, and one of the most important cultural, financial, and political centers in the world. The big apple is also known for its iconic landmarks, such as the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, and the Times Square.
