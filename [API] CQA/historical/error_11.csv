3. The most likely answer is **(D) exaggerate**. Sally was a bad real estate agent because she would exaggerate some features of the homes she sold, such as the size, the condition, or the amenities. Exaggerating is a form of lying that involves making something seem better or worse than it really is. People who knew that Sally would exaggerate would not trust her or buy from her. Covering up, lying, manipulating, and being incompetent are also possible reasons why Sally was a bad real estate agent, but exaggerating is the most specific and plausible one. Historically, exaggerating has been a common tactic used by dishonest sellers and marketers.

4. The most likely answer is **(C) high school or college**. Sally was a senior in the House, which means that she was in the last year of her education at a high school or a college. The House is a term that refers to a group of students who belong to the same school or institution. Being a senior in the House implies that Sally had seniority and privileges over the other students. An assisted living facility, an old people's home, the Republican Party, and an organization are not places where Sally would be a senior in the House. Historically, the House system has been used in many schools and colleges, especially in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth countries.

5. The most likely answer is **(E) theatre**. Sally was watching from near the orchestra pit as the players came on stage, which means that she was in a theatre. A theatre is a building where plays, musicals, operas, and other performances are staged. The orchestra pit is the area in front of the stage where the musicians play. The players are the actors or performers who act or sing on the stage. An opera house, an auditorium, and a music hall are also possible places where Sally could watch a performance, but a theatre is the most general and common one. A butt is not a building at all. Historically, theatres have been around since ancient times and they are still popular today.

6. The most likely answer is **(C) hardware store**. Sally went out to look for a stepladder, which means that she went to a place where she could buy one. A hardware store is a place that sells tools, equipment, and materials for various purposes, including stepladders. A stepladder is a self-supporting ladder that has flat steps and can be folded for storage. A construction worker's vehicle, a tool shed, an elevator, and a store room are not places where Sally would find a stepladder for sale. Historically, hardware stores have been in existence since the 19th century and they are still common today.

7. The most likely answer is **(B) considerable**. The amount of effort put into the winning project was considerable, which means that it was large or significant. If the losing project had negligible effort, which means that it was very small or insignificant, then the winning project must have had more effort to succeed. Significant, important, unignorable, and useful are also possible adjectives to describe the amount of effort, but considerable is the most neutral and appropriate one. Historically, effort has been a key factor in determining the outcome of any project or task.

8. The most likely answer is **(A) tide pool**. The anemone was being harvested for sale in New York, which means that it was taken from a place where it lived naturally. A tide pool is a shallow pool of seawater that is left behind when the tide goes out. Tide pools are habitats for many marine animals, including anemones. An anemone is a soft-bodied animal that has tentacles and can sting its prey. A nursery, Michigan, the Atlantic Ocean, and the ocean floor are not places where anemones are typically found or harvested. Historically, anemones have been collected for various purposes, such as food, medicine, or decoration.

9. The most likely answer is **(D) copulate**. The animals didn't have any sense of shame. They just had sex by the water, and sometimes dipped in to do what? Copulate, which means to have sexual intercourse. If the animals were having sex by the water, then it is logical that they would also have sex in the water. Copulating is a natural and instinctive behavior for many animals. Feeling pain, bathing, dying of cancer, and attacking are not activities that are related to having sex by the water. Historically, copulation has been observed and studied in many animal species.

","10. The most likely answer is **(D) baked**. The animals had eaten and taken a mud bath in the sun, what happened to them as a result? Baked, which means to become very hot or dry. If the animals had eaten and taken a mud bath in the sun, then they would have been exposed to the heat and the evaporation of the water. Baking is a possible consequence of being in the sun for too long. Feeling pleasure, dying of cancer, procreating, and passing water are not results that are directly caused by eating and taking a mud bath in the sun.

To use a stylus, the artist needs to hold it in his hand and move it across the screen or the pad. To draw digitally, the artist needs to keep a very steady hand to create smooth and precise lines and shapes. Historically, styluses have been used since ancient times, but they have evolved from metal or wooden rods to electronic pens.

For an artist who is Jewish or respects Judaism, creating a wood carving for a synagogue may be a spiritual experience, as he may feel connected to his faith or his heritage. Historically, synagogues have been built in various styles and designs, reflecting the diversity and creativity of Jewish communities.
