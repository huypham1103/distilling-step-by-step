Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","2. The most likely answer is **(A) apartment**. An apartment is a common type of housing for young people who live in urban areas, especially if they share the rent with roommates.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","4. The most likely answer is **(E) helicopter**. A helicopter is a type of aircraft that can lift straight up from the ground, because it has a rotor that spins rapidly and creates a downward thrust of air. A helicopter can also hover, move sideways, or tilt in any direction, unlike a fixed-wing aircraft that needs a runway to take off and land. An electric motor, a jet engine, a rotator, or a train are not able to lift straight up, and they do not have a rotor that moves a lot of air.

8. The most likely answer is **(E) living room**. A living room is a room in a home where people can relax, socialize, watch TV, or entertain guests. A living room may have a rug that covers the floor and adds comfort and style to the room. A living room may also have popcorn strewn about if people eat popcorn while watching a movie or a show, or if they have a popcorn fight.

A shelf can be part of a cupboard, either fixed or adjustable, depending on the space and the needs of the user. If a shelf was showing signs of instability, meaning it was wobbly, loose, or broken, it should be fixed by the carpenter to avoid any issues, such as falling objects, damaged items, or injuries. The carpenter should check the cupboard that contains the shelf and see if there are any problems with the hinges, screws, nails, brackets, or supports that hold the shelf in place. The carpenter should also inspect the wall or the furniture that the cupboard is attached to and make sure it is stable and secure.

8. The most likely answer is **(D) busy city**. A busy city is a large and densely populated urban area that has a high level of economic, social, and cultural activity.

A shopping arcade can be part of a larger building, such as a mall, a hotel, or an office complex, or it can be a separate structure, such as a historic or a modern arcade. A shopping arcade can offer a variety of goods and services, such as clothing, jewelry, books, art, food, entertainment, and more. If a shopping arcade had a lot of foot traffic, meaning it had many people walking through it, it would be located in a busy city, where there is a high demand and a large market for shopping and leisure.

9. The most likely answer is **(C) stores**. Stores are places where goods or services are sold to customers, either in person or online.

Stores can also have different formats and locations, such as brick-and-mortar stores, online stores, pop-up stores, mobile stores, and more. A shopping center is a group of stores and other businesses that are located together in a building or an area and share a common parking lot or a pedestrian area. A shopping center can have various names and styles, such as mall, plaza, strip mall, outlet, and more. A shopping center can offer a wide range of goods and services, such as clothing, electronics, furniture, health, beauty, and more. If a shopping center was empty and needed tenants, meaning it had vacant spaces and no businesses occupying them, it would solicit stores, meaning it would invite, attract, or persuade stores to rent or lease the spaces and operate in the shopping center. Soliciting stores would help the shopping center fill the empty spaces, increase the variety and the quality of the goods and services, attract more customers and visitors, and generate more revenue and profit.

A small dog that looked longingly into a warm home and laughing family would want to have its own home where it could be loved and cared for. A cold room, a suburb, or a nursing home are not desirable places for a dog. An own house is similar to a home, but it does not imply the same emotional attachment.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","9. The most likely answer is **(A) warm place**. A warm place is a location that has a high temperature or provides heat.

","10. The most likely answer is **(D) sun itself**. To sun itself means to expose oneself to the sun's rays. A snake that was very cold inside its cage would do this at the first opportunity to warm up and increase its metabolism. A snake can bask in the sun on a rock, a branch, or a grassy area. A pet, a rude, a tropical forest, or a tree are not actions that a snake would do."

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","1. The snake was worried about predators overhead, where did it go for cover?

The most likely answer is **(B) tropical forest**. Snakes are cold-blooded animals that need to regulate their body temperature by moving between sun and shade. Tropical forests provide a lot of cover from predators such as birds of prey, as well as a variety of habitats and food sources for snakes. Historically, snakes have evolved in tropical and subtropical regions, and many species are endemic to these areas.

They enter a building to use it as a shelter and a base, but first they have to make sure it is secure, meaning that it has no enemies, traps, or threats inside or outside. Historically, soldiers have used buildings as fortifications, barracks, or headquarters in various situations.
