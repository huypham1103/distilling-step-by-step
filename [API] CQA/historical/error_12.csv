Speed is a measure of how fast something moves or changes, and it is influenced by various factors, such as distance, time, force, and resistance.

7. The most likely answer is **(E) floor**. The floor is the lower surface of a room or a building, usually made of wood, concrete, tile, or carpet. Sitting on the floor can be uncomfortable, especially for a long time, because it can cause back pain, stiffness, coldness, or dirtiness. John was waiting for his plane for hours, which means that he was at an airport, a place where airplanes take off and land. His butt hurt from sitting in a hard plastic chair all that time, which means that he was sitting on a chair that was not soft or cushioned, and that caused him pain or discomfort. But it was still better than sitting on the floor, which means that he preferred the chair over the floor, even though it was not very comfortable. Office, living room, bedroom, and airport are not things that John could sit on, but places that he could be in. Airports are facilities that provide services for air travel, such as terminals, runways, control towers, and security. Airports have been in use since the early 20th century, and have expanded and modernized over time.

8. The most likely answer is **(D) desk**. A desk is a piece of furniture that has a flat or sloped surface, usually with drawers, shelves, or compartments, and that is used for writing, reading, working, or studying. John was writing into the wee hours, which means that he was writing late at night or early in the morning, for a long time. Because of this he left a mess where, which means that he did not clean up or organize the place where he was writing, and that it was cluttered or dirty. The most likely place where John was writing was his desk, where he would have his writing materials, such as paper, pen, laptop, or books. Apartment, table, closet, and night stand are not the most likely places where John was writing, because they are either too big, too small, or not suitable for writing. Writing is the activity of using symbols, such as letters or characters, to communicate ideas, information, or stories. Writing has been practiced by humans since ancient times, and has developed into various forms and styles.

9. The most likely answer is **(B) play tricks on**. To play tricks on someone means to deceive, confuse, or mislead them, usually for fun or mischief. John wasn't in his right mind, which means that he was not thinking clearly, rationally, or logically, or that he was mentally ill or disturbed. His brain did what to him, which means that his brain was the cause or source of his mental state, and that it affected his perception, memory, or cognition. The most likely thing that his brain did to him was to play tricks on him, which means that his brain made him see, hear, or believe things that were not true or real. Tended, picture experience, form images, and manual are not things that his brain did to him, but rather things that his brain did for him, or that he did with his brain. The brain is the organ that controls the nervous system, and is responsible for various functions, such as sensation, movement, emotion, learning, and reasoning. The brain is one of the most complex and mysterious parts of the human body, and its workings are not fully understood.

10. The most likely answer is **(A) theatre**. A theatre is a place where plays, musicals, operas, or other forms of performing arts are presented to an audience. John watches the well dressed people from a catwalk above the stage, which means that he observes the actors or performers from a narrow platform that is suspended above the stage, and that is used for lighting or scenery. He listens to them speak rehearsed lines while the audience listens, which means that he hears them say the words that they have memorized and practiced for the show, and that the audience also hears them. The most likely place where John is is a theatre, where he might be a technician, a director, or a critic. New York City, fashion show, construction site, and school play are not the most likely places where John is, because they are either too specific, too different, or too small for the description. Theatre is a form of art that involves live performance, dialogue, action, and spectacle. Theatre has been practiced by humans since ancient times, and has evolved into various genres and styles."
