Fingers serve a dual function of helping humans grasp and manipulate objects, as well as enabling them to perform fine motor skills, such as writing, typing, playing musical instruments, or doing crafts. Two arms, two eyes, and lay eggs are not things that humans have an abundance of. Video game is not a body part.

Emotional, very adaptable, left or right handed, and selfish are not ways that humans are born, but rather traits that they develop or acquire later in life.

","8. The most likely answer is **(E) battlefield**. A paper that is signed and ends a conflict is likely a peace treaty or an armistice, which are agreements between warring parties to stop fighting and resolve their disputes. A battlefield is a place where a battle or a war is fought, and where blood is often spilled. A vein, a person, a paper, or a clinic are not places where blood would hit in the context of a conflict.

Pleasure is a positive emotion that is associated with satisfaction, happiness, or enjoyment. Expensive things may provide pleasure by fulfilling one's desires, needs, or preferences, or by enhancing one's status, image, or identity. Cross street, value life, go into debt, and to be sad are not reasons why people like to enjoy expensive things.

A table is a convenient and accessible place to put the mail. A neighbor's house, a post office, a fridge, or a bathroom are not places where people would normally put the mail they brought in."

Writing an essay, organizing thoughts, summarizing main points, and having information are all possible ways of sharing information, but they are not as historically common or universal as speaking information.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","3. The most likely answer is **(A) die at home**. Historically, many people who hated hospitals preferred to die at home, surrounded by their loved ones and familiar things. Dying at home was seen as a more peaceful and dignified way of passing away than dying in a hospital, which was often associated with pain, suffering, and impersonal care. Thanking god, climbing a tree, loving objects, and climbing stairs are all possible wishes, but they are not as historically plausible or common as dying at home.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","4. The most likely answer is **(E) understand**. Historically, knowing the answer is not enough if one does not understand it. Understanding the answer means being able to explain it, apply it, and evaluate it. Understanding the answer also implies doing something with it, such as sharing it, using it, or improving it. Being ignorant, correct, ignorant, or having learnt are all possible states of mind, but they are not as historically meaningful or desirable as understanding.

","5. The most likely answer is **(B) urban region**. Historically, a turnpike is a type of road that charges a toll for using it. Turnpikes were often built to connect rural areas with urban regions, where there were more opportunities for trade, commerce, and industry. Driving to work, using an atlas, visiting the countryside, or going to the eastern united states are all possible destinations, but they are not as historically related or likely as going to an urban region.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","1. The most likely answer is **(E) headaches**. Watching television too much can strain the eyes and cause headaches, especially if the screen is too bright or too close.

Competition can also provide a sense of achievement, satisfaction, and reward for the player who wins. Some historical examples of games that involve competition are **chess**, **poker**, and **soccer**.

6. The most likely answer is **(D) hard water**. Water that comes from a faucet is usually hard water, which means that it contains a high concentration of minerals, such as calcium and magnesium. Hard water can have some benefits, such as providing essential nutrients and enhancing the taste of some beverages, but it can also have some drawbacks, such as leaving scale deposits on pipes and appliances, reducing the effectiveness of soap and detergent, and causing skin and hair problems. Some historical examples of places that have hard water are **London**, **Las Vegas**, and **Beijing**.
