They are home to many marine animals, including crabs. This has been a common practice for recreational and commercial fishing since ancient times. Cape cod, rocky mountains, virginia, and outside are less likely places to catch crabs, either because they are too specific, too high, too inland, or too vague.

The age of entry to high school varies, but it is usually around 14 or 15 years old. This has been the case since the late 19th century, when high schools became more widespread and accessible.

Working, networked, cost money, and crash are less likely things that John wanted to do by giving away internet ready computers, either because they are too selfish, too technical, too negative, or too destructive.

2. The most likely answer is **(B) open plain**. John might go to an open plain to find a wild gazelle because gazelles are herbivorous animals that live in grasslands and savannas. They are native to Africa and Asia, and some species have been introduced to other continents. Kalahari desert, sheep pen, trophy room, and ball gown are less likely places to find a wild gazelle, either because they are too harsh, too domesticated, too artificial, or too absurd.

3. The most likely answer is **(D) stationery store**. John would go to a stationery store to buy a writing instrument and paperclips because stationery stores sell various items for writing, drawing, and organizing papers. This has been the case since the 18th century, when stationery shops emerged as a distinct type of retail business. Desk drawer, office supply store, writer's hand, and purse are less likely places to buy a writing instrument and paperclips, either because they are too personal, too professional, too abstract, or too small.

7. The most likely answer is **(C) attic**. John was cleaning up and found pics from his trip to California in something old. He probably found them in an attic because an attic is a space at the top of a house that is often used for storage. It is a common place to find old and forgotten items, such as photos from a past trip. This has been the case since the 17th century, when attics became more common in architecture. Suitcase, television, fridge, and newspaper are less likely things that John found his pics in, either because they are too mobile, too modern, too cold, or too disposable.

8. The most likely answer is **(D) pizza box**. John was disgusted when he opened this and saw mold. This is a pizza box because a pizza box is a cardboard container that is used to deliver or store pizza, which is a baked dish of bread, cheese, and toppings. Pizza boxes often have leftover pizza inside, which can grow mold if left for too long. This has been the case since the mid-20th century, when pizza delivery became more popular and convenient.

Glass, fly, ocean, and surface of earth are less likely things that the ship might do, either because they are too solid, too aerial, too large, or too terrestrial."
