Newspapers are made by big rolling machines that print the stories on large sheets of paper that are then folded and cut into smaller pieces. A tree, recycled, written on paper, or local are not accurate descriptions of how the stories are transferred to the paper.

Provide historical context in your rationale.

- Answer: **(A) leak**
- Rationale: A leak is a hole or crack in a roof that allows water to enter and damage the ceiling. This is a common problem for roofs that are old, poorly maintained, or exposed to harsh weather conditions. A leaky roof can cause the ceiling to become soggy, which means wet and soft. This is a logical inference based on the given information and general knowledge of roofs and ceilings.
- Historical context: Leaky roofs have been a problem for humans since they started building shelters. Ancient civilizations used various materials and techniques to prevent or repair leaks, such as clay, straw, tar, tiles, and shingles. Modern roofs are made of more durable and waterproof materials, such as metal, asphalt, and rubber, but they can still develop leaks over time or due to damage.

A wheel chair is a device that helps people with mobility impairments to move around. A wheel chair accessible chess board is one that is designed to accommodate the height and width of a wheel chair, so that the players can reach and move the pieces comfortably. A wheel chair accessible chess board would be a reasonable and considerate feature for a retirement community that has residents who use wheel chairs and enjoy playing chess.
- Historical context: Chess is one of the oldest and most widely played board games in the world. It originated in India in the 6th century and spread to Europe and Asia through trade and cultural exchange.

Fall is typically associated with cooler weather, shorter days, and changing colors of the leaves. Many children dread fall and having to go to school, because it means that they have to end their summer vacation, which is a period of time when they can enjoy more freedom, fun, and leisure. Going to school can also be stressful and challenging for some children, as they have to face academic pressure, social pressure, and new expectations. Going to school is a common and realistic scenario that many children can relate to and fear.
- Historical context: Schooling is a universal and essential aspect of human society and development. The history of schooling can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, and Greece, where formal education was reserved for the elite and privileged classes. The concept of universal and compulsory education emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, as a result of the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and the democratic movements.

5. The child was scorned for scratching the plate with his what?
- Answer: **(C) fork**
- Rationale: A fork is a utensil that is used for eating or serving food. A fork typically has a handle and two to four prongs that are used to pierce, lift, or hold food. A fork is usually made of metal, plastic, or wood, and it can come in different sizes, shapes, and styles. A plate is a flat and round dish that is used for holding or serving food.

8. The most likely answer is **(A) accomplish**. A feat is an achievement that requires great skill, strength, or courage. To accomplish something means to achieve or complete something successfully. To make progress means to advance or improve in something, but not necessarily to achieve or complete it. To stop arguing means to end a dispute or a disagreement, but not necessarily to achieve or complete anything. To do business means to engage in commercial transactions or activities, but not necessarily to achieve or complete anything either. A concert is a musical performance by one or more singers or instrumentalists, not a synonym of feat. Historically, reaching a tentative agreement means reaching a provisional or preliminary settlement or understanding that is subject to further negotiation or confirmation. It can be a feat to accomplish, especially when the two sides have conflicting interests, demands, or expectations, and have to compromise, cooperate, or communicate to reach a common ground.

9. The most likely answer is **(D) talking to God**. A knell is a sound of a bell, especially when rung solemnly for a death or a funeral, not an action of praying. To kneel down means to lower one's body by bending one's knees, usually as a sign of respect or worship, but not necessarily an action of praying either. To talk to God means to communicate with God, usually by speaking aloud or silently, expressing one's thoughts, feelings, or requests. This is the most common and direct way of praying. To ask for help means to request assistance or support from someone or something, which can be a part of praying, but not the whole action. The faithful are the people who have a strong belief in God or a religion. Historically, praying has been a central practice of many religions, as a way of connecting with the divine, seeking guidance, giving thanks, or asking for forgiveness. Praying can take various forms, such as reciting words, singing songs, performing rituals, or meditating.
