Some churches, especially those that follow the prosperity gospel, preach that giving money to the church or its leaders will result in blessings, miracles, or prosperity from God. Other places, such as stadium, hockey game, baseball game, or movie theater, are not likely to have speakers who ask for money in exchange for good things."

Killing people may also result in people bleeding, going to jail, getting arrested, or going to prison, but these are not the same as dying. Bleeding is the loss of blood from the body.

Billy may hate watching the turtle move because he thinks that it is a stupid animal that moves slowly, clumsily, or aimlessly. He may be annoyed by all of the stupidity that he sees in the turtle's behavior or appearance. Ridiculous, enjoyment, relaxation, and like are not synonyms for stupidity, but different words that have different meanings. Ridiculous is something that is absurd or laughable.

","10. The most likely answer is **(B) not awake**. Not awake is the state of being asleep or unconscious. Billy is going to sleep, which means that he is going to enter a state of not being awake for the next few hours. Sleeping is a natural and periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes are closed and there is little or no consciousness or movement. Snoring, loss of consciousness, latency, and sleep walking are possible phenomena that may occur during sleep, but they are not the same as sleep itself. Snoring is the act or sound of breathing noisily through the nose or mouth while asleep. Loss of consciousness is the state of being unaware of one's surroundings or identity due to injury, illness, or drugs. Latency is the delay between a stimulus and a response. Sleep walking is the act of walking or performing other actions while asleep."
