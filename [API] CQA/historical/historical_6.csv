2. The most likely answer is **(E) smile**. To smile is a facial expression that indicates happiness, pleasure, or amusement. It is also a common way of expressing gratitude or appreciation to someone. Smiling is a universal gesture that transcends language and culture barriers. A person who is thanking everybody for coming might give them each a big smile as a sign of sincerity and warmth.

3. The most likely answer is **(B) bruise**. A bruise is a mark on the skin caused by bleeding under the skin, usually due to an injury or trauma. Bruises can vary in color, size, and shape, depending on the severity and location of the damage. A person who is the victim of a random punching might find a bruise on his body as a result of the impact and force of the punch.

4. The most likely answer is **(B) grotesque**. Grotesque is an adjective that means distorted, unnatural, or ugly, especially in a way that evokes horror or disgust. It is often used to describe something that is contrary to the norms of beauty or aesthetics. A person who is told everybody is beautiful in their own way, but sees himself in the mirror and finds it grotesque, might suffer from low self-esteem, body dysmorphia, or depression.

5. The most likely answer is **(E) firm**. Firm is an adjective that means solid, rigid, or resistant to pressure or force. It is also used to describe something that is reliable, stable, or strong. A person who is trying to buy a new mattress might want something soft yet firm, as a way of balancing comfort and support for his back and spine.

6. The most likely answer is **(E) answers**. Answers are the solutions or explanations to questions, problems, or puzzles. They are usually the result of applying logic, reasoning, or knowledge to the given information. A person who is trying to contemplate a formula, as it comes to him, might fill out the answers on a paper, a calculator, or a computer.

7. The most likely answer is **(D) processed**. Processed is an adjective that means altered or modified from its natural state, usually by adding artificial substances, chemicals, or preservatives. Processed foods are often considered unhealthy, as they may contain high amounts of salt, sugar, fat, or additives that can harm the body. A person who is trying to eat more green, as in simple ingredients, might avoid processed foods, as a way of improving his diet and health.

8. The most likely answer is **(D) wrong**. Wrong is an adjective that means incorrect, false, or mistaken. It is also used to describe something that is immoral, unjust, or harmful. A person who is trying to explain to his religious parents that stopping being married to his ex was the right thing to do, but they still find it wrong, might face a conflict of values, beliefs, or expectations with his parents, who might have a different view of marriage and divorce.

9. The most likely answer is **(A) raise interest rates**. Interest rates are the percentages that are charged or paid for the use of money, usually by banks, lenders, or borrowers. Interest rates can affect the supply and demand of money in the economy, as well as the inflation rate, which is the general increase in the prices of goods and services over time. A business show might yammer about how to fight inflation with a certain percentage to raise interest rates, as a way of reducing the amount of money in circulation and encouraging saving rather than spending.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","1. The most likely answer is **(C) become wet**. Washing hands involves using water and soap, which makes the hands wet. This is a common and expected outcome of washing hands. The other choices are either unlikely or irrelevant. Jazz hands are a gesture of spreading the fingers and shaking the hands, which has nothing to do with washing hands. Health is a general term that refers to the state of well-being, not a specific result of washing hands. Skin irritation and dry skin are possible side effects of washing hands too frequently or using harsh soap, but they are not the most likely or immediate outcomes.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","2. The most likely answer is **(C) content**. Cashing in means exchanging chips or tokens for money after winning at a casino. This would bring a smile of contentment to the person who was well ahead, meaning they had won more than they had expected or invested. Contentment is a feeling of satisfaction and happiness with one's situation. The other choices are either too vague or too specific. Happiness is a general term that does not capture the nuance of contentment. Count money, celebrate, and get money are actions that the person might do after cashing in, but they are not feelings that would bring a smile.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","3. The most likely answer is **(A) home**. If the person was too worried about his things and cleaning up, it implies that he was responsible for the place where the party was held. The most probable place where he would have such responsibility is his own home. The other choices are either less likely or irrelevant. A fraternity house is a place where college students who belong to a fraternity live and socialize, but it is usually shared by many members who would help with the party. A boat is a vehicle that floats on water, not a common place for a party. A friend's house is a place where someone else lives, not the person who was worried. Blowing off steam is an idiom that means relieving stress or anger, not a place.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","4. The most likely answer is **(A) football stadium**. The team that plays every Sunday is most likely a football team, since football is a popular sport in the United States that has most of its games on Sundays. A snap is a term that refers to the start of a play in football, when the ball is passed from the center to the quarterback. To see a snap live, the fan would have to enter a football stadium, where the games are held. The other choices are either unrelated or incorrect. A hot room is a room that has a high temperature, not a place to watch a game. A hockey game is a different sport that uses a puck and a stick, not a snap.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","5. The most likely answer is **(E) sleep**. If the person went to relax and be in nature more than anything, he did not go fishing just to sleep. Sleeping is an activity that does not require fishing or being in nature, and it would defeat the purpose of enjoying the outdoors. The other choices are either related or possible. Catching fish and catch fish are both outcomes of fishing, which the person might have done as a secondary goal. Wade in is an action that involves walking in shallow water, which the person might have done as part of fishing or relaxing. Fall into water is an accident that might happen while fishing, but it is not something the person would do intentionally.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","6. The most likely answer is **(C) Georgia**. The Bulldog school in the south is most likely the University of Georgia, which is located in the state of Georgia. The university's mascot is the bulldog, and it is one of the oldest and largest public universities in the United States. The humidity is a measure of how much water vapor is in the air, which affects how hot or cold it feels. The south is a region of the United States that has a humid subtropical climate, meaning it has hot and humid summers and mild winters. The brother who lived there would be used to the humidity, but the visitor who came from a different climate would find it intense. The other choices are either too broad or too narrow. Air is the mixture of gases that surrounds the earth, not a specific location. Atlanta is the capital and largest city of Georgia, but it is not the only place where the brother could live or study. Countryside and landscape are terms that describe the natural features of an area, not the state or region.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","7. The most likely answer is **(E) aim**. Hitting a bottle is a game or a challenge that involves throwing or shooting something at a bottle and trying to knock it down or break it. To do this, the person would need to have very good aim, which is the ability to direct something accurately at a target. The other choices are either irrelevant or negative. Buying beer and alcoholism are both related to drinking alcohol, not hitting a bottle. Spirit is a term that can mean the soul, the mood, or the courage of a person, not the skill of hitting a bottle.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","8. The most likely answer is **(D) blisters**. Blisters are small pockets of fluid that form on the skin as a result of friction, heat, or infection. Wearing the wrong shoes while walking all day can cause blisters on the heels and toes, which are the parts of the feet that rub against the shoes. The other choices are either too general or unrelated. Exercise, moving forward, and locomotion are all terms that describe the act of moving the body, not the result of wearing the wrong shoes.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","9. The most likely answer is **(D) supermarket**. A supermarket is a large store that sells food and other household goods. The person who worked in the back unloading large containers from delivery trucks would most likely work at a supermarket, since they would always have food in them. The other choices are either less likely or incorrect. A factory is a place where goods are manufactured, not sold. A garden is a place where plants are grown, not stored. A warehouse is a place where goods are stored, not sold. A warehouse is also repeated as an option, which makes it an invalid choice.
