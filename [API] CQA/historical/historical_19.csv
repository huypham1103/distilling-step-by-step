Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","2. The most likely answer is **(C) scattering**. Alley cats are stray or feral cats that live in urban areas, especially in alleys. They are usually wary of humans and other animals, and tend to form groups or colonies for protection and survival. A loud crash is a sudden and noisy sound that could indicate danger or threat, such as a car accident, a falling object, or a gunshot. When alley cats hear a loud crash, they are likely to react with fear and panic, and try to escape or hide from the source of the noise. Scattering is a verb that means to disperse or separate quickly in different directions. The other options are not plausible because they do not describe the alley cats' reaction to the loud crash. Disburse and dispense are synonyms that mean to pay out or distribute money or resources, which are not relevant to the alley cats. Charming is an adjective that means pleasing or attractive, which does not fit the context of the loud crash. Spread is a verb that means to extend or cover a larger area, which is the opposite of what the alley cats would do.
