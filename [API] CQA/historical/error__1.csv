","8th centuries. It is very quiet and delicate, so it was usually played in private rooms or parlors, not in public venues like music halls or movie shows. A museum might display a clavichord as a historical artifact, but it would not be a common place to hear it being used.

2. The most likely answer is **(D) soccer game**. A coach is a person who trains and instructs a team or an individual in a sport or other activity. In Europe and South America, soccer (or football) is a very popular sport, and coaches are often seen at soccer games, guiding their players and giving them feedback. A coach might also be involved in other sporting events, but soccer is the most prevalent one in these regions. A coach would not be expected to play football, go to a laundry mat, or watch a hockey game.

3. The most likely answer is **(E) speeding ticket**. A speeding ticket is a citation issued by a police officer to a driver who exceeds the legal speed limit. James is driving to work very quickly because he is late, which means he is at risk of getting a speeding ticket if he is caught by the police. Speeding tickets can result in fines, points on the driver's license, or even suspension of driving privileges. James might also use more gas, get to work, or experience boredom or anxiety, but these are not as direct or serious consequences as getting a speeding ticket.

4. The most likely answer is **(C) desk**. A clipboard is a thin board with a clip at the top that holds papers together. It is often used to write on or to organize documents. James kept a clipboard where he could easily find it, which means he probably used it frequently for his work or studies. The most logical place to keep a clipboard would be on a desk, where James could access it whenever he needed it. A shelf, a place of work, an office supply store, or a school might also have clipboards, but they would not be as convenient or personal as a desk.

5. The most likely answer is **(B) airport**. A connection is a term used to describe a situation where a traveler has to change from one flight to another at an intermediate airport. James was delayed for a couple of hours because he had a connection, which means he had to wait at an airport for his next flight. A connection can cause delays due to factors such as weather, security, or availability of seats. A company, a wall, a computer network, or a love might also have connections, but they would not cause James to be delayed for hours.

6. The most likely answer is **(D) turn right**. The outside lane is the lane that is closest to the edge of the road, usually used for overtaking or turning. James was driving away from work and slid into the outside lane, which means he was preparing to make a turn. Up ahead, he would have to turn right, because that is the direction that the outside lane leads to. If he wanted to turn left, he would have to slide into the inside lane, which is closer to the center of the road. Taking a u-turn, crashing, or getting to town are not logical outcomes of sliding into the outside lane.

7. The most likely answer is **(B) satisfaction**. Revenge is the act of harming or hurting someone who has wronged or harmed you in some way. Sometimes, people who are wronged feel the need to get revenge, because they think it will bring them satisfaction, or a sense of justice or closure. Satisfaction is the feeling of pleasure or fulfillment that comes from achieving a goal or desire. However, revenge can also bring disappointment, or a sense of regret or sadness, if it does not solve the problem or makes it worse. Being happy, having ownership, or feeling joy are not common results of getting revenge.

8. The most likely answer is **(A) aloft**. Aloft is an adverb that means in the air or high above the ground. The balloons were aloft, because they were filled with gas that was lighter than air, which made them rise and float in the sky. The boy stood below the balloons and studied them closely, but he did not see anything holding them up, because they did not need any strings or wires to stay aloft. Overhead, upwards, upstairs, and above are also words that describe the position of the balloons, but they are not as specific or accurate as aloft.

","10. The most likely answer is **(C) failure**. Failure is the state or condition of not meeting a desired or intended objective. Studying for taking final exams can be nerve wracking, especially if you are afraid of failure, or not passing the exams or the course. Fear of failure can cause anxiety, stress, or low self-esteem, which can affect the performance and motivation of the students. Success, graduation, anxiety, or studying are not things that students are usually afraid of, but rather goals or challenges that they face."

2. The most likely answer is **(B) play music**. This question is probably referring to the **Golden Age of Radio** in the United States, which lasted from the 1920s to the 1950s.
