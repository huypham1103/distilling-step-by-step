Flying in an airplane does not necessarily mean you like birds, need to get home, go half an hour away, or go someplace specific.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","1. The most likely answer is (C) become cold. When you get wet, the water on your skin evaporates and takes away some of your body heat. This can make you feel cold, especially if there is a breeze or low temperature. Shivering is a possible consequence of becoming cold, but not a direct effect of getting wet. Shrinkage is a term that refers to the reduction of the size of the penis or testicles when exposed to cold water, but it does not affect the whole body. Not drying is a trivial answer, since it is obvious that you will remain wet if you do not use a towel. Getting melted is a nonsensical answer, since human bodies are not made of substances that can melt.

","3. The most likely answer is (A) tomb. A tomb is a place where dead people are buried, often with their belongings and clothes. Finding a bone wrapped in cloth could indicate that you are in a tomb, especially if the cloth is old or decayed. A museum is a place where historical or cultural artifacts are displayed, which could include bones and cloth, but they would usually be in a case or a display, not lying around. An arm is a part of the human body, which could have a bone and cloth, but it would not make sense to ask where you are if you are in your own arm. A human body is a more general term for the whole organism, which could also have bones and cloth, but again, it would not make sense to ask where you are if you are in your own body.

","4. The most likely answer is (E) castle. A rook is a piece in the game of chess, which has the shape of a tower with battlements. A child who is not familiar with chess might call it a castle, since it resembles a miniature version of a fortified building. Juggling is an activity where objects are thrown and caught in the air, which has nothing to do with a rook or a castle. Trees are plants that have a woody stem and branches, which also have nothing to do with a rook or a castle.

In underpants drawer is a place where you might store something, but it is not what you will do with it. Wanting more is a desire that you might have after getting something, but it is not what you will do with it.

An undercover shopper is a person who is hired by a company or an organization to evaluate the quality of products or services by posing as a regular customer. They buy products, then after doing a review, they get money as a compensation for their time and expenses. Comparing prices is something that an undercover shopper might do as part of their review, but it is not what they would do after it. Saving money is something that an undercover shopper might do with the money they get, but it is not what they would do after the review. Paying money is something that an undercover shopper might do before the review, when they buy the products, but it is not what they would do after it.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","8. The most likely answer is (B) resentment. Resentment is a feeling of anger or bitterness towards someone who has done something unfair or wrong. If you have a lot of money after cashing in your chips at a casino, it means that you have won a lot of money from gambling. The casino owner might feel resentment towards you, because they have lost money to you, and they might think that you are lucky or cheating. Betrayal is a feeling of being deceived or let down by someone who you trusted or cared about. The casino owner might not feel betrayal towards you, unless they had a personal relationship with you, or they expected you to lose. Getting money is something that you would do after cashing in your chips, but it is not what the casino owner would feel towards you. Revenge is a feeling of wanting to harm or hurt someone who has harmed or hurt you. The casino owner might feel revenge towards you, but it is not the most likely answer, since they might not have a way to get back at you, or they might accept their loss as part of the business.
