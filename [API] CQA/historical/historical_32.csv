The US has used various types of bombs, such as conventional, smart, bunker-buster, and drone, to target the enemies and their infrastructure in Afghanistan.

8. The most likely answer is **(A) grieve**. When the baby birds fell out of the nest, the mom bird did grieve.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","10. The most likely answer is **(B) wool**. When the farmer was reproducing sheep, what one sheep gave later was wool. Historically, sheep have been domesticated for thousands of years for their wool, which is a valuable and versatile material that can be used to make clothing, blankets, carpets, and other products. Wool is also renewable, biodegradable, and fire-resistant. Sheep can produce wool every year, and they need to be sheared regularly to maintain their health and comfort."

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","1. The most likely answer is **(D) warehouse**. A warehouse is a large building where goods are stored, usually for commercial purposes. A man who needed storage for his personal belongings would probably look to rent a warehouse if he had a lot of items or valuables that he wanted to keep safe and organized. A building, a dumpster, an attic, and Michigan are not very suitable options for storing personal belongings. A building is too vague and could mean anything from a house to an office. A dumpster is a container for waste disposal and not a place to store belongings. An attic is a space under the roof of a building, usually in a house, and not something that can be rented separately. Michigan is a state in the United States and not a storage option.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","2. The most likely answer is **(A) being clear**. Being clear means that the water is transparent and free of dirt, impurities, or contaminants. A man who was preparing for having a bath would probably look for the water to be clear so that he could clean himself properly and enjoy the bath. Being clear is also a historical preference for bathing water, as people have used various methods to filter, purify, or boil water for bathing purposes. Get wet, bathing soap, will drown, and personal cleanliness are not things that one would look for in the water, but rather outcomes or actions related to bathing. Get wet is what happens when one comes in contact with water. Bathing soap is a product that is used with water to wash oneself. Will drown is a risk or fear of being submerged in water. Personal cleanliness is a goal or benefit of bathing.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","3. The most likely answer is **(E) pick up**. Pick up means to collect or retrieve something from a place. A carrier who failed to deliver a package due to nobody being home would probably have to pick up the package and return it to the delivery center or try to deliver it again later. Pick up is also a common practice for carriers when they encounter a failed delivery attempt, as they usually leave a notice or contact the recipient to arrange a pick up. Receiving, ship, keep, and take away are not things that a carrier would have to do in this situation. Receiving is what the recipient does when they get the package. Ship is what the carrier does when they send the package. Keep is what the carrier does when they retain the package for themselves, which is illegal and unethical. Take away is what the carrier does when they remove the package from the delivery place, which is similar to pick up but less specific.

Provide historical context in your rationale. 
","4. The most likely answer is **(A) become depressed**. Become depressed means to develop a state of low mood and reduced interest or pleasure in life. A person who realized his dog ran away would probably become depressed, as losing a pet can be a traumatic and heartbreaking experience. Become depressed is also a historical reaction to losing a dog, as dogs have been considered as loyal companions and sources of emotional support for humans for a long time. Park, pay bills, promise to do, and welcome change are not things that a person would feel in this situation. Park is a place where people or dogs can play or relax. Pay bills is an obligation or responsibility that people have to fulfill. Promise to do is a commitment or vow that people make to themselves or others. Welcome change is an attitude or mindset that people have towards new situations or opportunities.
