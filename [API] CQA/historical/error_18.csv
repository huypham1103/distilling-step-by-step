Pride is a feeling of satisfaction and self-esteem that arises from one's achievements, possessions, or status. Pride can also be a source of ambition and greed, as one may seek to acquire more power, wealth, or influence. Historically, pride has been a driving force behind many conquests and expansions, as rulers and nations have sought to dominate and control more land and resources. For example, in the 19th century, the British Empire was the largest and most powerful empire in history, covering about a quarter of the world's land area and population, and was motivated by a sense of pride and superiority over other peoples and cultures.

7. The most likely answer to the question 'My company is vertical. How do I make it more horizontal?' is **(D) change strategies**. A vertical company is a company that has a hierarchical structure, where the decision-making and authority are concentrated at the top levels, and the lower levels have little or no autonomy or input. A horizontal company is a company that has a flat structure, where the decision-making and authority are distributed among the employees, and the communication and collaboration are encouraged and facilitated. Historically, companies have adopted different strategies and structures depending on their goals, markets, and environments. For example, in the 1980s, General Motors, which was a vertical company, faced a decline in its market share and profitability due to its rigid and bureaucratic organization, and had to change its strategies and adopt a more horizontal and flexible structure to compete with its rivals, such as Toyota, which was a horizontal company.

8. The most likely answer to the question 'My company's auditors are extremely worried about my practices. Should I care?' is **(A) liquidated**. Liquidated means to sell off or dispose of the assets of a company, usually to pay off its debts or liabilities. If a company's auditors are extremely worried about its practices, it means that the company is engaging in unethical, illegal, or fraudulent activities, such as embezzlement, tax evasion, or accounting fraud, which can expose the company to legal actions, penalties, or lawsuits. Historically, many companies have been liquidated or bankrupted due to their corrupt or dishonest practices, which have harmed their reputation, credibility, and trustworthiness. For example, in 2001, Enron, which was one of the largest and most respected energy companies in the world, collapsed and was liquidated after it was revealed that it had been manipulating its financial statements and hiding its losses and debts, resulting in one of the biggest corporate scandals in history.

Live crabs can cause problems or inconveniences in most offices, such as making noise, creating mess, escaping, or biting. Historically, most offices have had rules or policies that prohibit or restrict the presence of live animals, especially those that are exotic, dangerous, or disruptive. For example, in 2013, a woman in Florida was fired from her job at a call center after she brought a live crab to her office and placed it on her desk, claiming that it was her emotional support animal.
