A guard station is a place where guards or soldiers are stationed to protect or patrol an area, but it is not a place where moving lines are watched. A hospital is a place where people who are sick or injured are given medical treatment. You can find a monitor wall that is used for watching moving lines in a hospital, as it can show the electrocardiogram (ECG) or the heart rate of the patients."
