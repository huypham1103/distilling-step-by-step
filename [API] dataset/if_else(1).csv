Applying conditional statements, we can evaluate the connection between the premise and the hypothesis:

If the premise ""Pedestrians, one with a small dog in a pink jacket, are waiting to cross an intersection"" is true, then it is likely that the hypothesis ""A group is waiting for the signal to change so they can cross"" is also true.
