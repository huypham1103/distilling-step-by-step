The commonly agreed-upon answer to the premise 'A young man is having his dreadlocks cutoff by a woman with scissors' and hypothesis 'The young man is bald' is ""contradiction"".

The commonly agreed-upon answer to the premise 'Two men are standing in front of musical mixing equipment' and hypothesis 'There are people indoors' is ""entailment"".

Therefore, there is entailment between the two statements.
