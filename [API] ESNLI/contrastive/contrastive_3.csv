Highlight what sets your choice apart from the others.
","6. The most likely answer is **neutral**. This means that the hypothesis is neither supported nor contradicted by the premise. The premise and the hypothesis are about the same man and the same guitar, but they differ in one aspect: the singing. The premise does not mention whether the man is singing or not, while the hypothesis does. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily true or false based on the premise. Entailment would mean that the hypothesis follows from the premise, which is not the case here. Contradiction would mean that the hypothesis negates the premise, which is also not the case here.
