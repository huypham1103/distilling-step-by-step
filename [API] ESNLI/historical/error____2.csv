","**Rationale:** A no fly zone is a designated area where aircraft are prohibited from flying, usually for security or military reasons. The US and its allies imposed a no fly zone over Libya in 2011 to protect civilians from the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, who was trying to suppress a popular uprising. The no fly zone was enforced by NATO aircraft and missiles, and lasted until the end of the civil war in October 2011. The premise states that US troops are keeping calm in a no fly zone at one of the crucial points in Tripoli, the capital of Libya. The hypothesis states that a group of troops are attempting to stay quiet. The hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise, because the premise does not specify the reason or the situation of the US troops in the no fly zone.

","**Rationale:** Swimming is the act of moving through water by using the limbs, body, or fins.
