7. The answer is **contradiction**. A crowded street, in an Asian country, where the buildings are dominated by the Seiko building contradicts that the crowds are at an indoor swimming meet. A swimming meet is a competitive event where swimmers race against each other in a pool. An indoor pool is a pool that is located inside a building and is usually covered by a roof. The premise and the hypothesis describe two very different locations and activities that are incompatible with each other.

8. The answer is **entailment**. A crowded street, in an Asian country, where the buildings are dominated by the Seiko building entails that lots of people are in the street.
