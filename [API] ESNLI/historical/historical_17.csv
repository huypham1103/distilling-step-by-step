If a group of people is sitting at a table outside talking, then they are also sitting together outside and talking over drinks, assuming that there are drinks on the table.

It is possible that a man stands at the bar ordering drinks for his friends who are sitting at a table outside talking, but it is not certain. The hypothesis is neither true nor false given the premise. Historically, bars are places where people can order and consume alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages, and they are often located near or inside restaurants.
