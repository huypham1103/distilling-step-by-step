Provide historical context in your rationale.
","10. The answer is **contradiction**. The premise and the hypothesis are about the same group of people, but they differ in the activity. The premise says that the man in a wheelchair and the blond woman play badminton with three youths, which implies that they are using racquets and shuttlecocks. The hypothesis says that the couple and children are running in a marathon, which implies that they are using their legs and feet. Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis are logically incompatible. Historically, running in a marathon is an impossible feat for a person in a wheelchair, so the hypothesis is implausible."

","1. The answer is **entailment**. This means that the hypothesis is true given the premise. The premise and the hypothesis are logically equivalent, as they both describe the same situation using different words. A crippled woman and a disabled woman are both terms that refer to a woman with some physical impairment that affects her mobility. Playing a sport and participating in a sport are both terms that refer to engaging in a physical activity that involves rules, competition, or skill. Historically, there have been many examples of women with disabilities who have played various sports, such as wheelchair basketball, paralympic swimming, or adaptive skiing.

**Answer: Neutral**

**Rationale:** The premise does not provide any information about the number of passengers or cargo on the plane, so the hypothesis is neither true nor false based on the premise. The answer is neutral. Historically, the capacity of a plane depends on its size, model, and configuration.
