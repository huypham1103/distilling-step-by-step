","1. The answer is **contradiction**. A contradiction is when the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. In this case, the premise implies that the boy is in a natural body of water, such as a lake or a river, while the hypothesis states that he is in his backyard pool, which is an artificial body of water. These two scenarios cannot be true at the same time, so they contradict each other.
