7. The answer is **neutral**. A neutral relation occurs when the hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise, but is possible. In this case, the premise states that the pictures are of women, while the hypothesis states that the women are pretty. The premise does not specify the appearance of the women, so the hypothesis could be true or false, but it is not incompatible with the premise. Historically, beauty is a subjective concept that varies across cultures and individuals, so there is no objective way to determine whether the women are pretty or not.

8. The answer is **entailment**. An entailment occurs when the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise. In this case, the premise states that there are a few onlookers watching a person hanging up pictures of women, while the hypothesis states that there are people watching another person hang up pictures. The hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, so it is entailed by the premise. The hypothesis is more general than the premise, but it does not contradict or add any new information to the premise.

9. The answer is **contradiction**. A contradiction occurs when the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. In this case, the premise states that the people are surrounded by bikes, while the hypothesis states that the people are in the ocean. These two locations are mutually exclusive, so the hypothesis contradicts the premise. Historically, bikes are vehicles that are used on land, not in water, and the ocean is a large body of water that covers most of the earth's surface.
