4. The most likely answer is **neutral**. The premise and the hypothesis are unrelated to each other, and they describe two different scenes.

Historically, singing is a form of musical expression that involves producing sounds with the voice, and it can be performed solo or in groups. Purses are small bags that are used to carry personal items, such as money, keys, or cosmetics, and they are typically carried by women.

5. The most likely answer is **neutral**. The premise and the hypothesis are not incompatible, but they are not necessarily connected either. The premise describes a man singing on a stage, but it does not specify the genre or the purpose of his singing. The hypothesis assumes that he is a gospel singer practicing for a show, but this is not implied by the premise. The hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise.

The hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, and it does not add or remove any information. Historically, stepping stones are small, flat stones that are placed in a shallow body of water, such as a stream or a pond, to allow people to cross over without getting wet. They are often used as a decorative feature in gardens or parks.

7. The most likely answer is **contradiction**. The premise and the hypothesis are incompatible with each other, and the hypothesis negates the premise. The premise describes a young woman sitting on stepping stones in a small pond, and the hypothesis states that a young woman is sleeping at home. The hypothesis is false if the premise is true, and it contradicts the premise.
