The premise only tells us that the dog was leaping through a hoop, but not why or how it felt about it. The hypothesis is a statement of preference or emotion, which cannot be verified by the premise. The historical context is that dogs are known to express emotions such as happiness, excitement, or fear, but these are not always easy to interpret by humans.
