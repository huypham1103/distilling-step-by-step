","1. The answer is **contradiction**. A man who is doing an ollie on his skateboard with people in the park in the background cannot be asleep in front of a cozy fire at the same time. These are two mutually exclusive scenarios that contradict each other. Historically, skateboarding is a sport that originated in the 1950s in California, USA, as a way of surfing on land. It involves riding and performing tricks on a skateboard, which is a wooden board with four wheels attached. An ollie is a basic skateboarding trick that involves jumping with the board without using the hands. A hoodie is a type of sweatshirt with a hood that covers the head. A cozy fire is a warm and comfortable fire that is usually lit in a fireplace inside a house.
