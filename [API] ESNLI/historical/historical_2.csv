","9. The answer is **contradiction**. This means that the hypothesis is false given the premise. The premise and the hypothesis describe incompatible scenes. The premise shows a skateboarder skating in the pool and the hypothesis shows a skate swimming in the pool. A skate is a type of fish, not a skateboard. There is some historical context needed for this question. Skateboarding is a sport that originated in the 1950s in California, USA. Skates are cartilaginous fish that belong to the same family as rays and sharks. They live in marine habitats and have flattened bodies and wing-like fins.

A skater grinds on the lip of the pool is a specific trick that involves sliding along the edge of the pool with the skateboard. Therefore, the hypothesis is a possible consequence of the premise. The historical context is that skateboarding in pools became popular in the 1970s, when droughts in California emptied many swimming pools and skaters used them as improvised skateparks.
