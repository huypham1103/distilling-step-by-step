Females holding another female in a room is a more general statement that does not specify the number, the age, or the clothing of the females. Therefore, the hypothesis is true given the premise, and they are an entailment.

","9. Premise: A person rappels down a steep incline., Hypothesis: a person is rappelling towards a waterfall.
- Answer: **Neutral**
- Rationale: A person rappels down a steep incline does not provide enough information to determine whether the person is rappelling towards a waterfall or not. The steep incline could be part of a mountain, a cliff, a building, or any other structure. A person is rappelling towards a waterfall is a more specific statement that assumes the location and the destination of the person.

","10. Premise: A person rappels down a steep incline., Hypothesis: a person is rappelling.
