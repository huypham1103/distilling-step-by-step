Provide historical context in your rationale.

**Answer: Neutral**

**Rationale:**

The hypothesis is not necessarily true or false given the premise. People walking around in a big city could have various destinations, and not all of them are parks. For example, they could be walking to their workplaces, shops, restaurants, museums, or other places. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. However, the hypothesis is also not contradicted by the premise. It is possible that some people walking around in a big city are indeed walking to the park, especially if the city has many parks or green spaces. Therefore, the hypothesis is not ruled out by the premise. The best answer is neutral, as the hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise.

Historically, big cities have been associated with urbanization, industrialization, and commerce, and not necessarily with parks or nature. However, some big cities have also developed parks and green spaces to provide recreational and environmental benefits for their residents and visitors. For example, New York City has Central Park, London has Hyde Park, and Paris has Jardin du Luxembourg. Therefore, it is not impossible to find people walking to the park in a big city, but it is also not a common or universal phenomenon.

Provide historical context in your rationale.
","2. Premise: People walking around in a big city., Hypothesis: People are outside.. Based on what is historically known, what is the most likely answer to the premise 'People walking around in a big city.' and hypothesis People are outside. with options ""entailment"", ""neutral"", ""contradiction""? Provide historical context in your rationale.

**Answer: Entailment**

**Rationale:**

The hypothesis is true given the premise. People walking around in a big city are necessarily outside, as walking is an outdoor activity. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. There is no way that the hypothesis could be false given the premise, as people walking around in a big city cannot be inside at the same time. Therefore, the hypothesis is not contradicted by the premise. The best answer is entailment, as the hypothesis is true given the premise.

Historically, walking has been a common mode of transportation and exercise for people living in big cities, especially before the advent of cars, buses, trains, and other vehicles. Walking is also a way of exploring and enjoying the sights and sounds of a big city. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that people walking around in a big city are outside, as that is the natural and logical implication of walking.

Based on what is historically known, what is the most likely answer to the premise 'People walking around in a big city.' and hypothesis The people are asleep. with options ""entailment"", ""neutral"", ""contradiction""? Provide historical context in your rationale.

**Answer: Contradiction**

**Rationale:**

The hypothesis is false given the premise. People walking around in a big city are necessarily awake, as walking is an awake activity. Therefore, the hypothesis is contradicted by the premise. There is no way that the hypothesis could be true given the premise, as people walking around in a big city cannot be asleep at the same time. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The best answer is contradiction, as the hypothesis is false given the premise.

Historically, sleeping has been a vital and universal human need that requires a certain degree of rest, comfort, and safety. Sleeping is usually done in a private and quiet place, such as a bed, a couch, or a tent. Sleeping is also usually done at night, when the natural light is dim and the temperature is cooler. Therefore, it is unreasonable to assume that people walking around in a big city are asleep, as that is the opposite and incompatible of walking"
