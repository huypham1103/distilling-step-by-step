The premise implies that the toddler is drinking from a cup in a toy car. Therefore, the hypothesis is false given the premise. A historical context that supports this answer is that toddlers are young children who are between one and three years old, who are still developing their physical, cognitive, and social skills. Toddlers are not capable of driving full-sized vehicles, which require legal, technical, and safety knowledge and abilities.

The premise tells us that the pilot is looking out of a British Airways airplane while two men are standing outside, and the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise.

The hypothesis is a possible situation, but not the only one. The pilot could be waiting to take off, or he could be waiting to land, or he could be in the middle of a flight.

The premise tells us that the pilot is looking out of a British Airways airplane while two men are standing outside, and the hypothesis is incompatible with the premise. The plane is over the ocean, but the premise implies that the plane is on the ground. The two men are standing outside, which means that they are not in the air or in the water.

The hypothesis is about pigs and cheese, which have nothing to do with the man, the helmet, the sun, or the water. The hypothesis could be true or false, but it is irrelevant to the premise. Historically, pigs have been domesticated animals that eat various foods, and cheese has been a dairy product made from milk.
