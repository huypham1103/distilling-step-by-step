**Rationale:** A Mohawk is a hairstyle that involves shaving both sides of the head and leaving a strip of hair in the middle. It is often associated with punk rock culture, which emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as a rebellious and anti-establishment movement. However, having a Mohawk does not necessarily imply that a person is a punk rocker or that they are not a college student. Therefore, the hypothesis is neither true nor false given the premise. It is possible that the man with a Mohawk is a kid at college, but it is not certain or implied by the premise.
