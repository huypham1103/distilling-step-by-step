","5. The most likely answer is **neutral**. This means that the hypothesis is neither true nor false based on the premise. In this case, the premise does not provide enough information to determine if the lady is shaving her legs or not. It is possible that she is sitting on a chair and shaving her legs, but it is also possible that she is not. Therefore, the hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise. The other options are not as good because they do not capture the uncertainty of the hypothesis. Entailment means that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, which is not necessarily the case here. Contradiction means that the hypothesis is false if the premise is true, which is also not necessarily the case here.

","7. The most likely answer is **contradiction**. This means that the hypothesis is false if the premise is true. In this case, the premise states that the child is pushing another kid in a wheeler, while the hypothesis states that the children are eating lunch. These two statements cannot be true at the same time, since a person cannot be pushing and eating at the same time, and a wheeler and a lunch are different objects. Therefore, the hypothesis is contradicted by the premise. The other options are not as good because they do not capture the logical inconsistency between the premise and the hypothesis.
