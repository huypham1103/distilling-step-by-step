","8. The most likely answer is **neutral**. This means that the hypothesis is neither confirmed nor contradicted by the premise. The premise states that a man and woman are running in a race, but this does not specify the nature or context of the race. It is possible that the race is an all-gender race in a ""Battle of the sexes"" day, but it is also possible that it is a different kind of race, such as a charity run, a marathon, or a relay. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, nor is it contradicted by it.
