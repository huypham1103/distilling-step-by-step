The premise states that an older man in jeans and a sweater is lifting down a box from the top of a pile, which implies that he is doing some physical work. The hypothesis states that the man is eating dinner, which implies that he is not doing any physical work. The hypothesis is incompatible with the premise, and it is false in any possible world where the premise is true.
