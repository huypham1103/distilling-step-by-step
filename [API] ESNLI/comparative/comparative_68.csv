Compare the options ""entailment"", ""neutral"", ""contradiction"" and identify the most likely answer to the premise 'A small dog is jumping on the dirt in front of some water' and hypothesis a cat jumping into the water. Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer is **contradiction**. This means that the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise.
