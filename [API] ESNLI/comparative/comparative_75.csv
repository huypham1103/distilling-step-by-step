The hypothesis tells us that the two modern buildings complete the setting, which implies that they make the surroundings whole or perfect. The hypothesis is a possible opinion, but not the only one. Some people might agree that the buildings complete the setting, while others might disagree and prefer a different kind of setting. Therefore, it is not an entailment, which means that the hypothesis follows logically from the premise. It is also not a contradiction, which means that the hypothesis is incompatible with the premise.
