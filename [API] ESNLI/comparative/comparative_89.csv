Explain why your choice is better than the others.
","1. The most likely answer is **contradiction**. This means that the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. The premise states that the person wearing the baby sling is a woman, while the hypothesis states that the person is a man. This is a clear contradiction, as the person cannot be both a woman and a man at the same time. The other options are not correct because entailment means that the hypothesis follows from the premise, which is not the case here, and neutral means that the hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise, which is also not the case here.
