9. The correct answer is **contradiction**. This means that the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. The cause-and-effect relationship is that the premise and the hypothesis differ in the type of vehicle and the direction of movement. The premise states that the person is on a type of go-cart, which is a vehicle that has four wheels and a steering wheel. The hypothesis states that the person is on a bicycle, which is a vehicle that has two wheels and a handlebar. These two types of vehicles are different, so the hypothesis is false given the premise. Moreover, the premise states that the person is riding downhill, which means that the person is moving from a higher to a lower elevation.
