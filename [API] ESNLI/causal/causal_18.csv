","7. The correct answer is **contradiction**. A contradiction occurs when the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise, meaning that they cannot both be true at the same time. In this case, the premise states that a man parasails in the choppy water, while the hypothesis states that the man parasailed in the calm water. These two statements are contradictory, as the premise and the hypothesis disagree on the condition of the water. The water cannot be both choppy and calm at the same time.
