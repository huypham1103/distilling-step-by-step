Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","1. The correct answer is **contradiction**. A contradiction occurs when the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. A conditional statement is a statement that can be written in the form ""if p, then q"", where p is the premise and q is the hypothesis. A contradiction can be shown by proving that the conditional statement is always false. In this case, we can write the conditional statement as follows:

- If an elderly man and woman are ready to maneuver a contraption, then a man and woman are sleeping in bed.

This statement is always false, because being ready to maneuver a contraption implies that they are not sleeping in bed. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise.
