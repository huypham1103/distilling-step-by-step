In this case, the premise states that the toddler is playing on a rope on a playground, which implies that the toddler is a child and that the toddler is on a playground. The hypothesis states that a child plays on a playground, which is a more general statement that is true whenever the premise is true. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis. A possible conditional statement to explain this is: If the toddler is playing on a rope on a playground, then a child plays on a playground.
