"A woman and three children, holding hands with each other, are crossing the street.",The woman and three children cross the street individually.,"Premise: A woman and three children, holding hands with each other, are crossing the street., Hypothesis: The woman and three children cross the street individually.. Given the premise 'A woman and three children, holding hands with each other, are crossing the street.' and hypothesis The woman and three children cross the street individually., which among the choices ""entailment"", ""neutral"", ""contradiction"", is the correct answer? Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","1. The correct answer is **contradiction**. A contradiction occurs when the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. In this case, the premise states that the woman and three children are holding hands with each other, which implies that they are crossing the street as a group. The hypothesis states that they are crossing the street individually, which contradicts the premise. We can use the following conditional statement to explain the reasoning:

If the woman and three children are holding hands with each other, then they are not crossing the street individually.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","2. The correct answer is **neutral**. A neutral relation occurs when the hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise. In this case, the premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the woman is the mother of the three children or not. The hypothesis is possible, but not necessarily true. We can use the following conditional statement to explain the reasoning:

If the woman is the mother of the three children, then they are holding hands with each other.

This statement is true, but it does not imply that the converse is also true. That is, it is not necessarily true that if they are holding hands with each other, then the woman is the mother of the three children.
