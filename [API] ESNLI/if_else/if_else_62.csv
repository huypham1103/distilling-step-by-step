","6. The correct answer is **contradiction**. The premise contradicts the hypothesis, because it is not possible that the girls are stretching their legs and skipping rope at the same time. A conditional statement that captures this reasoning is: If the girls are stretching their legs, then the hypothesis is false; otherwise, the hypothesis is true.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","1. The correct answer is **contradiction**. A contradiction occurs when the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. In this case, the premise states that the soccer team has green uniforms, while the hypothesis states that they have blue uniforms. This is a direct contradiction. We can write the conditional statement as follows: If the soccer team has green uniforms, then they do not have blue uniforms.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","3. The correct answer is **neutral**. A neutral relation occurs when the hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise. In this case, the premise states that the soccer team is performing a stretching exercise, but does not specify when. The hypothesis adds the detail that they are performing the exercise after a game, which is neither implied nor denied by the premise. We can write the conditional statement as follows: If the soccer team is performing a stretching exercise, then it is possible that they are doing it after a game.

","4. The correct answer is **contradiction**. A contradiction occurs when the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. In this case, the premise states that the men are running in a race, while the hypothesis states that they are switching their numbers on their shirts. This is a contradiction, as it is unlikely that the men would do such a thing while running in a race.

","5. The correct answer is **contradiction**. A contradiction occurs when the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. In this case, the premise states that the men are running in a race, while the hypothesis states that they are moving supplies around in a garage. This is a contradiction, as it is impossible for the men to do both things at the same time.
