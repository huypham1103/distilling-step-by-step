In this case, the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise using a different word order. If the man parasails in the choppy water, then it is true that the water was choppy as the man parasailed. We can use the following conditional statement to explain the reasoning:

If a man parasails in the choppy water, then the water was choppy as the man parasailed.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","7. The correct answer is **contradiction**. A contradiction occurs when the hypothesis is logically incompatible with the premise. In this case, the hypothesis negates the premise by stating that the water was calm, which is false if the water was choppy. We can use the following conditional statement to explain the reasoning:

If a man parasails in the choppy water, then the water is not calm.

Explain your reasoning using conditional statements.
","8. The correct answer is **neutral**. A neutral relation occurs when the hypothesis is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premise. In this case, the hypothesis is possible but not certain given the premise. The water may have turned choppy as the man started to parasail, but the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny it. We can use the following conditional statement to explain the reasoning:

If a man parasails in the choppy water, then the water may have turned choppy as the man started to parasail.
