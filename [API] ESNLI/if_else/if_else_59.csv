","9. The correct answer is **contradiction**. This means that the hypothesis logically contradicts the premise. The reasoning is as follows: The premise tells us that the woman is in a pink coat standing in the snow beside a telephone booth, which implies that she is not on the beach. The hypothesis tells us that the woman is making a sandcastle on the beach, which implies that she is not in the snow. The two statements cannot be true at the same time. We can write this as a conditional statement: P -> ~H, where P is the premise and H is the hypothesis.
