6.
Reasoning:
By specifying that he had been farting and getting away with it, it implies that he didn't want a particular consequence to occur as a result of his actions.

Therefore, the most fitting choice is (B) problems. "

10. The question states that hurting someone else is a crime and carries consequences. Jail time, punishment, bad karma, and will resent are all potential consequences of hurting someone else.

752,"I feel hunger, but I don't want to get any food because work has been slow this month, what don't I want to do?","['drink', 'begin work', 'have lunch', 'eat quickly', 'spend money']",spend money,"3. The correct answer is (E) spend money. 
Reasoning: The statement mentions that the person doesn't want to get any food due to slow work, indicating a desire to save money. Thus, they wouldn't want to spend money.

Reasoning: The context of not paying the electricity bill suggests that the electricity might be cut off.

The statement ""I know the answer, but I do not do what to it?"" suggests that the person is aware of the correct answer but does not act upon it due to ignorance.

If you love crab but cannot find much where you live in a rural area, you would likely find more options at a fish market. Fish markets specialize in selling various types of seafood, including crab.

770,"I love to see an idea become a reality.  In order to accomplish that, I must do what?","['think', 'work hard', 'do about', 'study', 'patent']",work hard,"1. The correct answer is (B) work hard. This is because in order to see an idea become a reality, it requires putting in the effort and dedication to make it happen. Thinking, studying, and patenting are also important in the process, but without actually working hard to bring the idea to life, it will remain just an idea."
771,"I need a balloon to decorate something, what am I buying it for?","['sky', 'birthday party', ""child's hand"", 'grocery store', 'car']",birthday party,"2. The correct answer is (B) birthday party. This is because balloons are commonly used for decoration at birthday parties.

772,"I need to buy frozen food locally in the smaller shop, where would I go?","['grocery store', 'supermarket', 'refrigerator', 'freezer', 'fridge']",grocery store,"3. The correct answer is (A) grocery store. This is because smaller shops typically do not have a wide selection of frozen food, so the most likely place to find frozen food locally would be a regular grocery store. Supermarkets may have more options, but since the question specifies a smaller shop, the grocery store would be the best choice."
773,"I need to pick up a balloon after getting some snacks and a cake, where can I get all these things at once?","['fair', ""child's hand"", 'sky', 'birthday party', 'grocery store']",grocery store,"4. The correct answer is (E) grocery store. This is because a grocery store is likely to have all the items mentioned – snacks, a cake, and balloons – in one place. While a fair or a birthday party might have balloons, they may not have the snacks and cake. Similarly, a child's hand or the sky wouldn't be appropriate locations to get all these things at once."
774,"I need to store my honey, where should it go?","['stick to fingers', 'jar', ""farmer's market"", 'beehive', 'house']",jar,"5. The correct answer is (B) jar. This is because a jar is commonly used to store honey. While honey could potentially stick to fingers or be sold at a farmer's market, the most common and practical way to store honey is in a jar. A beehive is where honey is produced, not stored, and a house is unlikely to be a designated storage location for honey."
775,"I need to string a bass, where should I get the necessary supplies?","['manual', 'orchestra', 'marching band', 'bass guitar', 'music shop']",music shop,"6. The correct answer is (E) music shop. This is because a music shop is where one can typically find necessary supplies for stringing a bass. While a manual or a bass guitar may also be related to stringing a bass, the most likely place to find a variety of supplies specifically for this purpose would be a music shop. Orchestras and marching bands do not necessarily sell bass stringing supplies."
776,"I needed more knowledge and had a reputation for truancy, what did I need to go to more of?","['church', 'meeting', 'encyclopedia', 'university', 'class']",class,"7. The correct answer is (D) university. This is because if someone needs more knowledge and has a reputation for truancy (skipping class or not attending school regularly), they need to go to a university to attend classes and learn. While attending a church or a meeting may provide some knowledge, a university would be the best place to acquire a more comprehensive education."
777,"I needed my jeans washed when my electricity was cut off, where did I go?","['thrift store', 'clothing store', 'costume shop', 'shopping mall', 'laundromat']",laundromat,"8. The correct answer is (E) laundromat. This is because a laundromat is where one can wash clothes when their electricity is cut off. While a thrift store or a clothing store may sell jeans, they do not typically provide laundry services. A costume shop and a shopping mall would not have washing facilities."
778,"I needed new clothes before starting high school, what did I need to do?","['high school', 'ocean floor', 'container', 'downtown area', 'mall']",high school,"9. The correct answer is (E) mall. This is because malls are commonly where one can find a variety of clothing stores, making it a convenient place to shop for new clothes. While a high school or downtown area may have clothing stores as well, a mall would generally offer a broader range of options."
779,"I needed to find out how to contact a person with a certain name, where should I look?","['directory', 'michigan', 'roster', 'phone book', 'certificate']",phone book,"10. The correct answer is (A) directory or (D) phone book. This is because both a directory and a phone book contain contact information for people with certain names. While Michigan may have a directory or phone book, it is not specific to finding a person with a certain name. Similarly, a roster and a certificate would not typically contain contact information for individuals."
780,"I needed to send a piece of mail, where did I go?","['table', 'post office', ""neighbor's house"", 'railway station', 'fridge']",post office,"1. 
The correct answer is (B) post office. If you needed to send a piece of mail, the most logical place to go would be the post office, as that is where mail is typically sent. The other choices - table, neighbor's house, railway station, and fridge - do not have any direct connection to sending mail."
781,"I only like fiction books, why should I read a non-fiction book?","['knowledge', 'been printed new', 'many words', 'for fun', 'cover']",knowledge,"2. 
The correct answer is (A) knowledge. Although you may prefer fiction books, reading a non-fiction book can provide you with valuable knowledge and information. While the other choices - been printed new, many words, for fun, and cover - may apply to some non-fiction books, they do not necessarily address the reason why you should read a non-fiction book."
782,"I pay someone in a ticket booth for tickets to ""The Greatest Showman.""  Where am I likely to be?","['sports arena', 'auditorium', 'opera', 'movie theatre', 'metro station']",movie theatre,"3. 
The correct answer is (D) movie theatre. If you are paying someone in a ticket booth for tickets to ""The Greatest Showman,"" it is likely that you are at a movie theatre. The other choices - sports arena, auditorium, opera, and metro station - do not typically have ticket booths for movies."
783,"I put a towel in a cardboard box for the kitten, I wanted it to have what?","['farmhouse', 'zoos', 'cold place', 'floor', 'warm place']",warm place,"4. 
The correct answer is (E) warm place. By putting a towel in a cardboard box for the kitten, you are providing it with a warm place to rest. The other choices - farmhouse, zoos, cold place, and floor - do not necessarily provide warmth for the kitten."
784,"I put up a railing to make sure I don't fall at my house, but now when I sit outside it blocks my view, what am I sitting on?","['deck', 'stairwell', 'house', 'lawn', 'flight of stairs']",deck,"5. 
The correct answer is (A) deck. If the railing is blocking your view when you sit outside, it suggests that you are sitting on a deck. The other choices - stairwell, house, lawn, and flight of stairs - are unlikely to have a railing that obstructs your view when sitting."
785,"I really want a keyboard instrument, where should I go to try some out?","['music store', 'band', 'orchestra', 'accompany singer', 'museum']",music store,"6. 
The correct answer is (A) music store. If you want to try out a keyboard instrument, you would likely go to a music store where they have a variety of instruments available for testing. The other choices - band, orchestra, accompany singer, and museum - may not necessarily have keyboard instruments for trying out."
786,"I want a dog that's easy to spot, which one should I get?","['blind', 'fun', 'black', 'alive', 'playing dead']",black,"7. 
The correct answer is (C) black. If you want a dog that's easy to spot, getting a black dog would be a poor choice, as it would blend in with the surroundings. The other choices - blind, fun, alive, and playing dead - do not relate to the visibility of the dog."
787,"I want everyone to hear my voice, how should I speak?","['being heard', 'loud', 'upwards', 'beautiful', 'sound']",loud,"8. 
The correct answer is (B) loud. If you want everyone to hear your voice, speaking loudly would be the most effective way to make sure your voice carries. The other choices - being heard, upwards, beautiful, and sound - may not necessarily guarantee that your voice is heard by everyone."
788,"I want some original paintings to put on my wall, where should I go for instpiration?","['art show', 'classroom', 'labyrinth', 'corner', 'paint store']",art show,"9. 
The correct answer is (A) art show. If you are looking for original paintings to put on your wall, an art show would be a great place to find inspiration. The other choices - classroom, labyrinth, corner, and paint store - do not typically offer a wide selection of original paintings for inspiration."
789,"I want to create something new, what do I need?","['plasticulture', 'cookies', 'plamodel', 'cups', 'plastisol']",plasticulture,"10. 
The correct answer is (A) plasticulture. If you want to create something new, plasticulture, which refers to the use of plastic materials in agricultural practices, is not relevant. The other choices - cookies, plamodel, cups, and plastisol - are also not directly related to creating something new."
790,"I want to make a fortune selling houses, what should I study?","['real estate', 'treasure chest', 'stock market', 'business', 'bank']",real estate,"1. To make a fortune selling houses, the correct answer is (A) real estate. This is because real estate involves buying, selling, and managing properties, including houses. It is a specialized field that deals specifically with the housing market and can provide lucrative opportunities for those who are successful in it."
791,"I want to make new friends when I socialize at the party, what should I do?","['find friends', 'sing', 'mix', 'with people', 'see people']",mix,"2. To make new friends when socializing at a party, the correct answer is (C) mix.

Therefore, going to a grocery store would allow you to conveniently buy both frozen food and party supplies in one place."
793,"I wanted  a side chair for people to visit me while I worked, where did I have it put?","['building', 'office', 'library', 'table', 'bathtub']",office,"4. If you wanted a side chair for people to visit you while you worked, the correct answer is (B) office. This is because having a side chair in your office would provide a comfortable seating option for visitors who come to see you while you work. It is a common practice to have seating arrangements in an office for meetings or discussions."
794,"I wanted to stand up, what would I use to do this?","['feet', 'balance', 'effort', 'hands', 'courage']",feet,"5. If you wanted to stand up, the correct answer is (A) feet.

800,"I was entertained while watching film, what is my reaction to it?","['laughter', 'like', 'masturbation', 'joy', 'erection']",like,"1. Given the question 'I was entertained while watching film, what is my reaction to it?', we can eliminate choices (C) masturbation and (E) erection as they are not appropriate reactions to being entertained while watching a film. 
To further narrow down the choices, we can think about common reactions when something is entertaining. (A) laughter is a common reaction to being entertained, so it is a possible answer. However, (B) like can also be a valid reaction to being entertained. Therefore, both (A) laughter and (B) like can potentially be correct answers depending on personal preference. "
801,"I was having a bath for 4 hours, what might I suffer from physiologically?","['have fun', 'cold', 'get wet', 'being clean', 'wrinkled skin']",wrinkled skin,"2. Given the question 'I was having a bath for 4 hours, what might I suffer from physiologically?', we can eliminate choices (A) have fun, (C) get wet, and (D) being clean as they do not match the context of suffering from something physiologically. 
We can also eliminate (B) cold as it is unlikely to suffer from cold if one was in a warm bath for 4 hours. 
Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be (E) wrinkled skin, as prolonged exposure to water can cause the skin to wrinkle."
802,"I was in a kitchen that I didn't know, so I informally asked where the spoons were, where was I?","[""friend's house"", 'fraternity house', ""neighbor's house"", 'grandmas house', 'restaurant']",friend's house,"3. Given the question 'I was in a kitchen that I didn't know, so I informally asked where the spoons were, where was I?', we can eliminate choices (B) fraternity house, (C) neighbor's house, and (D) grandmas house as they do not match the context of being in a kitchen that one does not know. 
We can also eliminate (E) restaurant as it is unlikely for someone to informally ask where the spoons are in a restaurant. 
Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be (A) friend's house, as it is common to informally ask for location of items in a friend's house."

Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be (D) wreak, as it implies causing damage or chaos while intoxicated and driving a car."
804,"I was invited to a party but I'm not a social person, so I decided to do what?","['meeting', 'stay home', 'medium', 'blowing off steam', 'studying']",stay home,"5.

Explanation: In ancient times, people tried to chart each star by staring into the heavens.

Explanation: In order to have food to eat, people typically work for it.

The other choices, such as grow food, purchase food from webvan.com, browse, or shop, do not address the common action of working for food.

"

Correct Answer: (A) see king

Explanation: In the given context of the children's book, the cat was a great knight and was returning to the castle. The most logical reason for the cat to return to the castle is to see the king. This answer makes sense because the cat's achievement or accomplishment as a knight may require reporting or seeking acknowledgment from the king. The other choices, such as meow, have fleas, sleep all day, or live many years, do not align with the cat's role as a knight returning to the castle.

"
1217,"In the city the family didn't have a back yard, but now they did since they lived in a what?","['farm', 'suburb', 'property', 'neighborhood', 'yards']",suburb,"8. 
Correct Answer: (B) suburb

Explanation: In the city, the family did not have a backyard, but now they do because they live in a suburb.

The other choices, such as farm, property, neighborhood, or yards, do not specifically address the scenario of moving to a suburb to have a backyard.

"

Correct Answer: (B) unbreakable

Explanation: In the movie, a fragile man is causing accidents, and his hope is to find a person opposite of him who is unbreakable. This answer makes sense because if the fragile man is causing accidents due to his own fragility, he would need someone who is unbreakable to counterbalance or complement him. The other choices, such as undestroyable, indestructible, durable, or invisible, do not directly address the quality needed to counter the fragile man's accidents."
1220,"In the video game he used the rocket launcher at long range, but up close he would switch to the rapid fire what?","['pistol', 'assault rifle', 'submachine gun', 'grenade launcher', 'shotgun']",submachine gun,"1. The correct answer is (C) submachine gun. The question states that the character used the rocket launcher at long range and switched to rapid fire up close. The pistol and assault rifle are not mentioned specifically, so we can eliminate them as options. The grenade launcher is also a long-range weapon, so it would not make sense for the character to switch to it up close. The shotgun is a close-range weapon, but it is not mentioned in the question. Therefore, the best choice is the submachine gun, which is a rapid fire weapon suitable for close-quarters combat."
1221,"In war, your primary method is combat, but your goal is to do what?","['conquer opponent', 'fight enemy', 'join army', 'kill', 'terrible']",conquer opponent,"2. The correct answer is (A) conquer opponent. The question states that the primary method in war is combat, but the goal is to do something. Among the choices, only ""conquer opponent"" aligns with the idea of a goal in war. ""Fight enemy"" is redundant because combat is already mentioned as the primary method. ""Join army"" is a possible action, but it does not capture the overall goal of war. ""Kill"" is a violent action, but it does not signify a specific goal. ""Terrible"" is not a logical answer in the context of war. Therefore, ""conquer opponent"" is the most reasonable choice."
1222,"Index cards were on display at the museum, what kind of museum was it?","['office supply store', 'library', 'card catalogue', 'oral report', 'park']",library,"3. The correct answer is (B) library. The question states that index cards were on display at the museum. Among the choices, only a library is a place where index cards are commonly used and displayed, typically for organizing and cataloging information. An office supply store, a card catalogue, an oral report, and a park do not relate specifically to index cards, so they can be eliminated as options."

The question suggests that inspiration is the start of a process, and it takes creativity to do something. Among the choices, ""express yourself"" is a broad statement that can encompass various forms of expressing creativity, including creating art, writing, and expressing oneself in other ways. ""Create art"" is a more specific action, but it does not cover all possible forms of creativity. ""Sew"" is a specific skill, but it is not necessarily related to expression or creativity. ""Write"" is a specific action, but it does not capture the broader idea of expressing oneself. ""Express"" is a vague answer that does not provide enough context. Therefore, ""express yourself"" is the most fitting choice."
1224,"Instead of buying brand new pens, what part can you replace to keep using them?","['ink in', 'ink cartridges', 'take notes', 'color', 'caps']",ink cartridges,"5. The correct answer is (B) ink cartridges. The question asks about a part that can be replaced to keep using brand new pens. Among the choices, ink cartridges are a common component of pens that can be replaced when the ink runs out. ""Ink in"" does not specify a specific part of the pen that can be replaced. ""Take notes"" and ""color"" are actions, not parts of the pen. ""Caps"" are not typically replaceable parts of pens. Therefore, ""ink cartridges"" is the most logical choice."
1225,"It could have been a beautiful day, but what did the overcast sky do to the color?","['bee utiful', 'ugly', 'dull', 'plain', 'wet']",dull,"6. The correct answer is (C) dull. The question suggests that the overcast sky had an effect on the color of the day. Among the choices, ""dull"" is a suitable word to describe a lack of vibrancy or brightness caused by overcast conditions. ""Bee utiful"" is a made-up word that does not convey the intended meaning. ""Ugly,"" ""plain,"" and ""wet"" do not specifically relate to the effect of an overcast sky on color. Therefore, ""dull"" is the most appropriate choice."
1226,"It could have been a beautiful day, but what stopped the sun from shining?","['cloudy', 'grotesque', 'evil', 'hideous', 'ugly']",cloudy,"7. The correct answer is (A) cloudy. The question asks what stopped the sun from shining. Among the choices, only ""cloudy"" can prevent the sun's rays from reaching the ground and casting shadows. ""Grotesque,"" ""evil,"" ""hideous,"" and ""ugly"" are unrelated to weather conditions and the sun's ability to shine. Therefore, ""cloudy"" is the correct answer."
1227,"It had a beach with shallow water, while not the ocean this was a hot spot all the locals enjoyed on the what?","['swimming pool', 'pond', 'lake', 'bathe in', 'childrens pool']",lake,"8. The correct answer is (C) lake. The question describes a place with a beach and shallow water that is enjoyed by locals. Among the choices, only a lake fits this description. A swimming pool and children's pool are man-made structures that typically do not have beaches or natural shallow water. A pond may not have a beach or be suitable for swimming. ""Bathe in"" is a vague phrase without specifying a specific location. Therefore, ""lake"" is the most reasonable choice."
1228,"It is a lovely day, let's go outside and skate instead of doing what?","['really', 'put on helmet', 'sing', 'not work so hard', 'falling down']",not work so hard,"9. The correct answer is (D) not work so hard. The question suggests that going outside to skate is preferred over doing something else. Among the choices, ""not work so hard"" is the best option as it contrasts with the idea of going outside and enjoying leisure activities. ""Really,"" ""put on helmet,"" ""sing,"" and ""falling down"" do not relate directly to the concept of doing something else instead of skating. Therefore, ""not work so hard"" is the most fitting choice."
1229,"It is a teachers job to help students commit to memory new skills, what is the teachers main job in the classroom to help students do?","['make tape', 'memorize', 'never forget', 'concentrate', 'learn']",learn,"10. The correct answer is (E) learn. The question asks about the teacher's main job in the classroom to help students do. Among the choices, ""learn"" is the most appropriate answer as it encompasses the idea of acquiring new skills and knowledge. ""Make tape"" is not a typical responsibility of a teacher in a classroom setting. ""Memorize"" and ""never forget"" are specific actions that can contribute to learning, but they do not capture the broader concept of learning itself. ""Concentrate"" is a necessary component of learning, but it is not the main job of a teacher. Therefore, ""learn"" is the most logical choice."
1230,"It is hard to predict a rebound in basketball, this is because the ball and rim are what?","['dribbling', 'full of air', 'bouncing around court', 'punctured', 'round']",round,"1. The correct answer is (C) bouncing around court. When we talk about a rebound in basketball, it refers to the ball bouncing off the rim or the backboard after a missed shot. So, the ball and rim are bouncing around the court, making it difficult to predict where the ball will go after the rebound."

In this context, the phrase ""may have many an eye"" refers to the ""eyes"" or sprouts that develop on a potato when it starts to grow. However, despite having these ""eyes,"" a potato cannot see, and when you peel its skin off, you are removing the outer layer of the potato."

Answer: (E) anger

Reasoning: The question states that Jane saw her flirting with her boyfriend. Seeing this behavior would likely provoke a strong negative emotional response. Among the choices, only ""anger"" accurately represents a possible reaction to witnessing flirting between a friend and one's boyfriend. The other choices, such as jealousy or getting into trouble, are also negative reactions, but anger is the most fitting in this context."
1340,"Jane want to learn about riding a bike, what is a skill she needs to master in order to do so?","['laying down', 'peddle', 'falling over', 'pedaling', 'falling off']",pedaling,"1. The skill Jane needs to master in order to ride a bike is pedaling. This is because pedaling is the action required to propel the bike forward. Falling off, falling over, laying down, and peddling are not essential skills for riding a bike."
1341,"Jane was beautiful on the inside, but on the outside she wasn't much to look at.  How might she be described?","['sleepy', 'homely', 'misshapen', 'bad', 'overcast']",homely,"2. Jane might be described as homely. This is because the statement ""she wasn't much to look at"" implies that her physical appearance is not attractive. Sleepy, misshapen, bad, and overcast do not accurately describe her physical appearance in this context."
1342,"Jane was doing housework and started sneezing when she used a cleaning agent, what did the cleaner cause in her?","['pain and suffering', 'allergies', 'cleanliness', 'fever', 'boredom']",allergies,"3. The cleaner caused allergies in Jane. This is because the sentence states that Jane started sneezing when she used the cleaning agent, which suggests an allergic reaction. Pain and suffering, cleanliness, fever, and boredom do not logically connect to sneezing caused by a cleaning agent."
1343,"Jane was going to the party.  She didn't care about making friends or gorging on alcohol, she just wanted to do what?","['plan', 'meet new people', 'work', 'have fun', 'getting drunk']",have fun,"4. Jane just wanted to have fun at the party. This is because the sentence states that she didn't care about making friends or gorging on alcohol, which suggests she is primarily interested in enjoying herself. Planning, meeting new people, working, and getting drunk are not mentioned as her main motivations."
1344,"Jason seemed calm on the exterior, but his recent loses had made him what?","['anxious', 'frustrated', 'flustered', 'excited', 'calmness']",frustrated,"5. Jason's recent losses had made him frustrated. This is because the sentence states that he seemed calm on the exterior, but his recent losses had affected him emotionally. Anxious, flustered, excited, and calmness do not capture the emotional impact of his recent losses."
1345,"Jealousy led to the best contestant actually having scorecards lower, afterwards the what was investigated for their score given?","['love else', 'wage war', 'ocean', 'compete', 'judge']",judge,"6. The judges were investigated for their score given. This is because the sentence suggests that jealousy led to the best contestant receiving lower scorecards, so the judges' scoring decisions needed to be investigated. Love else, wage war, ocean, and compete do not have a logical connection to investigating scorecards."
1346,"Jenny answered the phone because this was what she did for a living.   She took a message and passed it on.  It was important, about a big project.  Where might Jenny be?","[""friend's house"", 'hotel', 'school', 'party', 'office']",office,"7. Jenny might be at the office. This is because the sentence states that Jenny answered the phone because it was what she did for a living, suggesting she is in a workplace environment. Friend's house, hotel, school, and party do not fit the description of a workplace."
1347,"Jenny answered the telephone because she couldn't stand the ringing. She shouldn't have though, because it wasn't here place.  She was just visiting. Where might she be?","['party', 'hotel', ""friend's house"", 'office', 'bedroom']",friend's house,"8. Jenny might be at a friend's house. This is because the sentence states that she was just visiting and it wasn't her place, implying that she is at someone else's house. Party, hotel, office, and bedroom do not fit the description of visiting someone else's house."
1348,"Jenny had trouble using the phone because she had to dial 9 to get an outside line.  And the manager wasn't very attentive to her needs, either.   Where might she be?","['office', 'hospital', ""friend's house"", 'hotel', 'every u.s']",hotel,"9. Jenny might be in a hotel. This is because the sentence states that she had to dial 9 to get an outside line, suggesting she is in a location with a phone system typically found in hotels. Office, hospital, friend's house, and every U.S do not have a logical connection to dialing 9 for an outside line."
1349,"Jeremy is mastering a music scale, where should he find books on the matter?","['post office', 'music store', 'assay office', 'butcher shop', ""doctor's office""]",music store,"10. Jeremy should find books on mastering a music scale at a music store. This is because music stores typically sell books and resources related to music education and training. Post office, assay office, butcher shop, and doctor's office do not typically specialize in selling music-related materials."

The question mentions that Jim enjoyed killing people, and the cops found out. In such cases, people who commit serious crimes like murder are usually sent to prison.

1356,"Jim never stopped talking, at what rate did he talk?","['continually', 'constantly', 'always forever', 'always', 'all day']",constantly,"7. The correct answer is (B) constantly. The question states that Jim never stopped talking. Constantly means without interruption, which accurately describes Jim's talking habit.

1714,"She felt like she never had any support, people always seemed to what?","['marriage', 'ignore', 'let down', 'aid', 'neglect']",let down,"5. The correct answer is (C) let down. We can reason this by using a conditional statement. If she felt like she never had any support, then it is likely that people always seemed to disappoint or let her down. Feeling ignored or neglected can also be indicators of a lack of support, but let down specifically refers to the feeling of being disappointed by others."
1715,"She felt like she was getting a cold, she was not looking forward to this what?","['let down', 'disappointment', 'satisfaction', 'gratitude', 'illness']",illness,"6. The correct answer is (E) illness. We can reason this by using a conditional statement.

1716,"She felt so alone on campus, she just wanted to be what?","['with someone', 'together', 'in crowd', 'many people', 'confined']",with someone,"7. The correct answer is (A) with someone. We can reason this by using a conditional statement. If she felt alone on campus, then it is likely that she just wanted to be with someone, implying a desire for companionship. Being together, in a crowd, with many people, or confined are also potential desires, but being with someone is the most common response to feeling alone."
1717,"She felt the need to continue to lose weight, this was despite her already being what?","['skinny', 'feel better', 'under weight', 'lift weights', 'healthy']",skinny,"8. The correct answer is (C) under weight. We can reason this by using a conditional statement. If she felt the need to continue to lose weight despite already being under weight, then it indicates an unhealthy desire for further weight loss. Being skinny or healthy may still leave room for weight loss, feeling better is not necessarily related to weight, and lifting weights does not necessarily imply a need for weight loss."
1718,"She filled the thing with water and went to plug it in, she had finally finished her garden with what centerpiece?","['stream', 'perfume', 'sink', 'fountain', 'swamp']",fountain,"9. The correct answer is (D) fountain. We can reason this by using a conditional statement. If she filled the thing (presumably a decorative structure or container) with water and finished her garden, then it suggests that the centerpiece of her garden would be a fountain. A stream, perfume, sink, or swamp are unlikely choices for a garden centerpiece."

If she decided to stop smoking because she heard it can cause something negative when trying to grow their family, then it is likely referring to the increased risk of birth defects associated with smoking during pregnancy. Pleasure, ill-omen, bad breath, and persistent cough are negative consequences of smoking, but birth defects directly relate to growing a family."
1720,"She found out who her father was, discovering truth had led her to feel what?","['conclusion', 'pain', 'very sad', 'relief', 'happiness']",happiness,1. The correct answer is (B) pain. This is because finding out the truth about her father can be emotionally difficult and painful.

1858,"Sometimes people are wronged, and sometimes getting revenge brings them what?","['being happy', 'satisfaction', 'ownership', 'joy', 'disappointment']",satisfaction,9. The correct answer is (B) satisfaction. The question suggests that sometimes people seek revenge when they are wronged. The motivation behind seeking revenge is often to find satisfaction or a sense of justice in making the wrongdoer suffer in some way.
1859,"Sometimes people seem like robots, but really we're all just what?","['stupid', 'inhumane', 'human', 'dangerous', 'strange']",human,"10. The correct answer is (C) human. The question implies that although people may sometimes seem robotic in their behavior, they are ultimately human. This suggests that people have unique emotions, thoughts, and experiences that distinguish them from robots."
1860,"Sometimes playing game means losing, he wasn't good at losing though and showed lots of what?","['having fun', 'entertain', 'injury', 'enjoying', 'anger']",anger,"1. The correct answer is (E) anger. The question states that the person was not good at losing and showed lots of something. Entertaining or having fun would be a positive reaction, which goes against the fact that the person wasn't good at losing. Injury and enjoying do not fit the context of the question. Anger is the most appropriate choice as it aligns with someone who is not good at losing and may display frustration or anger."
1861,"Sometimes the garbage men are sloppy, the garbage waste seems to miss the truck and end up in the where?","['street', 'sewer', 'landfile will not use for garbage', 'landfile', 'garbage dump']",street,"2. The correct answer is (D) landfill. The question mentions that the garbage waste seems to miss the truck, implying that it ends up somewhere else. Street and sewer are incorrect as they are not proper places for garbage waste to end up. Landfill not used for garbage is contradictory as landfills are specifically designed for waste disposal. Garbage dump does not have the same relevance as a landfill."
1862,"Sometimes things don't concern people themselves, this often leads them to what about the result?","['care less', 'talk to each other', 'play golf', 'trip over', 'pay attention']",care less,"3. The correct answer is (A) care less. The question indicates that when things don't concern people themselves, it leads to a certain outcome. Talking to each other, playing golf, tripping over, and paying attention do not directly relate to the lack of concern. Care less is the most logical answer as it implies a lack of interest or attention."
1863,"Sometimes when animals meet, what happens?","['fight each other', 'procreate', 'sleep', 'live lives', 'listen to each other']",fight each other,"4. The correct answer is (A) fight each other. The question asks about what happens when animals meet, suggesting some sort of interaction. Procreating, sleeping, living lives, and listening to each other are not specific to the act of meeting. Fighting each other is a common behavior seen when animals meet, as they establish dominance, territory, or defend themselves."
1864,"Sometimes when people think some wrongdoing has ocurred in government, how do they react?","['talk to each other', 'cook food', 'demand justice', 'learn from each other', 'share food']",demand justice,"5. The correct answer is (C) demand justice. The question states that when people think wrongdoing has occurred in government, they react in a certain way. Talking to each other, cooking food, learning from each other, and sharing food do not directly relate to the reaction of thinking wrongdoing has occurred. Demanding justice is the most appropriate choice as it aligns with seeking accountability and fairness."
1865,"Sometimes when you go into a deep trance, what happens when you no longer feel attached to your body?","['meditation', 'closed eyes', 'loss of control', 'tingling', 'memory loss']",loss of control,"6. The correct answer is (C) loss of control. The question states that when someone goes into a deep trance and no longer feels attached to their body, something happens. Meditation, closed eyes, tingling, and memory loss do not specifically indicate the experience of no longer feeling attached to the body. Loss of control is the most logical option as it suggests a detachment from physical sensations."
1866,"South America is in winter when North America is in summer, this is because it is located where?","['occident', 'america', 'southern hemisphere', 'far', 'western hemisphere']",southern hemisphere,"7. The correct answer is (C) southern hemisphere. The question mentions the contrasting seasons in South America and North America, implying a difference in location. Occident, America, far, and western hemisphere do not specifically address the location that causes the seasonal difference. The southern hemisphere is the most appropriate choice as it is the geographical region where South America is located."
1867,"Space, planets, moons and everything we can observe is part of what?","['front', 'sentence', 'universe', 'lifestyle', 'jar']",universe,"8. The correct answer is (C) universe. The question asks about the category that includes space, planets, moons, and everything we can observe. Front, sentence, lifestyle, and jar are not relevant categories for these objects. The universe is the most suitable choice as it encompasses all of these elements and is commonly understood to represent the entirety of space."
1868,"Sterotypically, people read the newspaper with their family early in the morning.  What is something else that people also do with their family when they first wake up?","['aggravation', 'go  for a walk', 'zip cup of tea', 'drink coffee', 'eat breakfast']",eat breakfast,"9. The correct answer is (E) eat breakfast. The question prompts the identification of another activity that people typically do with their family when they first wake up, similar to reading the newspaper. Aggravation, going for a walk, zipping a cup of tea, and drinking coffee do not necessarily involve the family aspect or align with the morning routine. Eating breakfast is a common activity that can be done together as a family in the morning."
1869,"Steve breathed in deeply, using his diaphragm.   The diaphragm is a muscle.  Name something that has muscles?","['human', ""woman's body"", 'valve', 'pay debts', 'drugstore']",human,"10. The correct answer is (A) human. The question asks for something that has muscles, which relates to the statement about Steve using his diaphragm. Woman's body, valve, pay debts, and drugstore do not fit the category of things that have muscles. Humans, including Steve, have muscles throughout their bodies, including the diaphragm."
1870,"Stood below the balloons and studied them closely.  As he looked to the sky, he didn't see anything holding them up.  He wondered what the balloons where?","['aloft', 'overhead', 'upwards', 'upstairs', 'above']",aloft,"1. The correct answer is (B) overhead. This is because the person stood below the balloons and looked up at them, suggesting that the balloons were located above them in the sky. The word ""overhead"" specifically refers to something located above and can be used in this context."
1871,"Stopping being married to each other might seem like a negative thing as it is an end, but it can also be a beginning that brings what?","['grief', 'confusion', 'relief', 'depression', 'happiness']",happiness,"2. The correct answer is (C) relief. This is because the question states that stopping being married can also be a beginning. The opposite of a negative thing like the end of a marriage would be a positive thing, and relief is often associated with the ending of a difficult or stressful situation."
1872,"Stopping being married to each other seemed to be the best option, they decided to what?","['being lonely', 'argue', 'get divorced', 'legal fees', 'pleasure']",get divorced,"3. The correct answer is (C) get divorced. This is because the question states that stopping being married was the best option. The best option for stopping being married would be to get divorced, as it is the formal legal process of ending a marriage."
1873,"Stopping being married to her allowed him to again pursue his dreams, it brought him what?","['depression', 'wrong', 'relief', 'rememberance', 'pleasure']",pleasure,"4. The correct answer is (C) relief. This is because the question states that stopping being married allowed the person to pursue their dreams again. Pursuing their dreams suggests a positive outcome, and the opposite of any negative feelings associated with the marriage ending would be relief."
1874,"Stopping being married to one another was a costly task, the lawyers and their what were astronomical?","['free time', 'pleasure', 'get divorced', 'legal fees', 'being lonely']",legal fees,5. The correct answer is (D) legal fees. This is because the question states that stopping being married was a costly task and mentions lawyers.

The correct answer is (D) depression. This is because the question states that stress can affect your mood, sometimes leading to something. Depression is a common mental health disorder that can be caused or worsened by stress."
1876,"Studying for taking final exams can be nerve wracking, especially if you're afraid of what?","['success', 'graduation', 'failure', 'anxiety', 'studying']",failure,"7. The correct answer is (C) failure. This is because the question states that studying for final exams can be nerve-wracking, especially if you're afraid of something. The opposite of success, which is often the goal of exams, would be failure."
1877,"Sure you could get a drink absolutely anywhere, but he found he lost less money if he was just at the bar where?","['nightclub', 'restaurant', 'miami', 'las vegas', 'new york city']",las vegas,"8. The correct answer is (A) nightclub. This is because the question states that the person found they lost less money if they were just at the bar. Nightclubs are often associated with higher prices and expensive drinks, suggesting that the person is likely to lose more money at a nightclub bar compared to other options."
1878,"Susan listened to the radio most of the day.  She didn't care for talk shows, so she mostly listened to the stations that did what?","['turn on', 'play music', 'eat cake', 'space shuttle', 'blaring']",play music,"9. The correct answer is (B) play music. This is because the question states that Susan didn't care for talk shows, so she mostly listened to the stations that did something. One of the most common things radio stations do is play music, making it the most logical choice."
1879,"Susan was a mean person. But even so, she could show what?","['mean cruel', 'friendly', 'kindness', 'nice', 'generous']",kindness,"10. The correct answer is (C) kindness. This is because the question states that Susan was a mean person but could still show something. The opposite of being mean is being kind, so kindness is the best choice in this context."
1880,"Susan was an ordinatry person, but her skills were not ordinary, they were what?","['exceptional', 'strange', 'spectacular', 'unusual', 'special']",exceptional,"1. The correct answer is (A) exceptional. The question states that Susan's skills were not ordinary, which implies that her skills were above average or exceptional compared to ordinary people. The other choices, strange, spectacular, unusual, and special, do not necessarily indicate that her skills were extraordinary."
1881,"Susan was attending a meeting of the KKK, even though she did not believe in their cause.  Why might she have been doing so?","['sharing ideas', 'sell hotdogs', 'fall asleep', 'getting information', 'sharing information']",getting information,"2. The correct answer is (D) getting information. The question states that Susan did not believe in the cause of the KKK, which suggests that she had a specific purpose for attending the meeting. Among the choices, getting information aligns with the idea that she might have been attending to gather information about the KKK and their activities. The other choices, sharing ideas, sell hotdogs, fall asleep, and sharing information, do not align as strongly with the given context."
1882,"Suzan is fiddling while Johnny, Jerry, and the rest are having some wild fun with not particular rhyme or pattern.  What might they be doing?","['shuffle', 'dancing about', 'troubles', 'square dancing', 'discovery']",dancing about,"3. The correct answer is (B) dancing about. The question states that Johnny, Jerry, and the rest are having wild fun with no particular rhyme or pattern. This suggests that they are engaging in some form of energetic movement or activity. Among the choices, dancing about best represents this kind of unstructured, wild fun. The other choices, shuffle, troubles, square dancing, and discovery, do not fit the context as well."
1883,"Suzie waited in a room covered with posters of celeberties and robots.  She liked this place, but she wished it was better decorated.  Where might she be?","['white house', 'school', ""friend's house"", 'museum', 'apartment']",friend's house,"4. The correct answer is (C) friend's house. The question describes a room covered with posters of celebrities and robots that Suzie likes but wishes were better decorated. This suggests that the room belongs to someone Suzie knows, such as a friend, and that the room is not professionally decorated. Among the choices, friend's house best fits this description. The other choices, white house, school, museum, and apartment, do not align with the given context."
1884,"Sweet is a great taste on its own, but it also goes great with what?","['bitter', 'salty', 'dry', 'sour', 'savory']",sour,"5. The correct answer is (B) salty. The question states that sweet is a great taste on its own, but it also goes great with something else. Among the choices, salty is the best complement to sweet in terms of taste pairing (e.g., salted caramel). The other choices, bitter, dry, sour, and savory, do not have the same strong association with sweet as salty does."
1885,"THe apiarist bought a new queen, where was the queen bound?","['england', 'beehive', 'farmyard', 'monarchy', 'deck of cards']",beehive,"6. The correct answer is (B) beehive. The question states that the apiarist bought a new queen, which suggests that the queen is related to bees. Among the choices, beehive aligns most closely with the context as the natural habitat or location for a queen bee. The other choices, England, farmyard, monarchy, and deck of cards, do not have the same direct association with bees or apiarists."
1886,"Talking to others can make you feel better, but when the people you talk to are mean, then can cause what?","['dry mouth', 'changing behavior', 'hurt feelings', 'communicating with others', 'anger']",hurt feelings,"7. The correct answer is (C) hurt feelings. The question states that when talking to mean people, it can cause something negative.

The other choices, dry mouth, changing behavior, communicating with others, and anger, do not capture the specific negative consequence of dealing with mean people as strongly."
1887,"Teachers play many roles such as babysitter, but they get the most out of just simply doing what?","['answering questions', 'teach children', 'writing', 'talk too much', 'open boxes']",teach children,"8. The correct answer is (A) answering questions. The question states that teachers play many roles, such as a babysitter, but they get the most out of simply doing what. Among the choices, answering questions aligns with the idea that teachers derive the most benefit or fulfillment from engaging with students and providing them with knowledge and guidance. The other choices, teach children, writing, talk too much, and open boxes, do not capture the primary role of teachers as effectively."
1888,"Terrorism is a nasty thing, though cause by a few it can lead to all out what?","['detonating bombs', 'help victims', 'death', 'sadness', 'war']",war,"9. The correct answer is (E) war.

1894,"The Canadian farmer wondered if potatoes would grow where he lived, where was his likely location?","['main course', 'prince edward island', 'ireland', 'french fries', 'idaho']",prince edward island,"5. The Canadian farmer wondered if potatoes would grow where he lived, where was his likely location?

The accelerator was controlled via a hand throttle, and the foot pedals controlled the steering in the small what? 
The answer is (A) car.

1900,"The accountant used a calculator regularly, he kept one at home and one at the what?","['desk drawer', 'desktop', 'office', 'wristwatch', 'city hall']",office,"1. The accountant used a calculator regularly, so he most likely kept one at a place where he frequently works. The options are desk drawer, desktop, office, wristwatch, and city hall. Since a wristwatch is not a place where you can keep a calculator, we can eliminate option (D). City hall is also not a likely place for an accountant to keep a calculator since it is a government building and not related to their work. Therefore, we can eliminate option (E). While a desk drawer and desktop are both places where someone might keep a calculator in their office, the question specifically mentions that the accountant kept one at home. Thus, we can eliminate option (A) desk drawer. This leaves us with the most likely answer, which is (C) office."
1901,"The act of traveling is simple, you're just what?","['relocation', 'disorientation', 'meeting new people', 'statue', 'getting somewhere']",getting somewhere,"2. The act of traveling is simple, and the question asks what you are doing while traveling. The options are relocation, disorientation, meeting new people, statue, and getting somewhere. Relocation means moving from one place to another, so it is a possible answer. Disorientation refers to a feeling of confusion in a new or unfamiliar place, and since the question states that traveling is simple, this might not be the correct answer. Meeting new people is a possible activity while traveling, but it is not necessarily the only thing you are doing. Statue and getting somewhere seem unlikely options, as they do not directly relate to the act of traveling. Based on the information provided, the most likely answer is (A) relocation."
1902,"The advertisement appeared outside of a central Wisconsin town, where was it located?","['web page', 'la ville', 'magazine', 'email', 'fargo']",la ville,"3. The advertisement appeared outside of a central Wisconsin town, so it must have been located in a place accessible to the residents of that town. The options are web page, la ville, magazine, email, and Fargo. A web page is accessible online and can be viewed by anyone with internet access, so it is a possible answer. La ville is French for ""the city,"" so it is not a specific location and can be eliminated. A magazine is a physical publication that can be distributed and accessed by people living in a certain area, so it is a possible answer. Email is a form of electronic communication and is not a physical location, so it can be eliminated. Fargo is the name of a city, but it is not within central Wisconsin. Based on the information provided, the most likely answers are (A) web page and (C) magazine."
1903,"The agent of change had a loath feeling for the king, he would set for a plan to have him what?","['recycled', 'inclined', 'disposed', 'avid', 'enthusiastic']",disposed,"4. The agent of change had a loath feeling for the king and wanted to take action against him. The options are recycled, inclined, disposed, avid, and enthusiastic. Avid and enthusiastic both mean having a strong interest or passion, so they do not match the negative feeling described in the question. Recycled means to use again or repurpose, which does not fit the context of the question. Inclined means having a tendency or preference for something and does not directly relate to taking action against someone. Disposed means to get rid of or remove, which matches the action the agent of change wants to take against the king. Therefore, the most likely answer is (C) disposed."
1904,"The aggressive soldiers were getting drunk, what are they at they at risk of doing with the locals?","['nausea', 'erections', 'fights', 'relaxation', 'procreation']",fights,"5.

Nausea refers to feeling sick or queasy, which does not match the context of the question. Erections refer to the physical response of the male body and do not directly relate to the soldiers' interaction with the locals. Fights match the aggressive behavior described in the question and being drunk can increase the likelihood of such conflicts. Relaxation is a possible outcome of drinking, but it does not specifically relate to the soldiers' interaction with the locals. Procreation refers to the act of reproduction and is not directly related to the situation described in the question. Based on the information provided, the most likely answer is (C) fights."
1905,"The aging rockstar had to finally stop playing guitar, his hands just wouldn't cooperate because of the what?","['singing', 'arthritis', 'listening to music', 'making music', 'playing music']",arthritis,"6. The aging rockstar had to finally stop playing guitar because his hands would not cooperate. The options are singing, arthritis, listening to music, making music, and playing music. Singing is not directly related to the ability to play guitar, so it can be eliminated. Arthritis is a condition that affects the joints and can cause pain or difficulty in movement, which matches the description of the rockstar's hands not cooperating. Listening to music does not directly relate to the rockstar's ability to play guitar, so it can be eliminated. Making music and playing music both involve active musical engagement, but the question specifically mentions the rockstar's hands not cooperating, suggesting a physical limitation. Therefore, the most likely answer is (B) arthritis."
1906,"The agricultural specialist walked from row to row, so where was he likely?","['sequence of similar things', ""farmer's field"", 'working field', 'auditorium', 'vegetable garden']",farmer's field,"7. The agricultural specialist walked from row to row, indicating that they were likely in a location with organized rows of similar things. The options are sequence of similar things, farmer's field, working field, auditorium, and vegetable garden. Sequence of similar things is a vague description and does not match the context of the question. Farmer's field and working field are both plausible options, as they involve organizing rows in agricultural work. However, the context of the question specifically mentions the specialist walking from row to row, suggesting that they are inspecting or working in the field. Auditorium is unrelated to agriculture and can be eliminated. Vegetable garden is a possible location, but it is not as specific as farmer's field or working field. Based on the information provided, the most likely answer is (B) farmer's field or (C) working field."
1907,"The air conditioning went out during a film, and the clientele walked out due to discomfort, what were they leaving?","['house', 'offices', 'book store', 'car', 'movie theatre']",movie theatre,"8.

The question specifically mentions that the air conditioning went out during a film, suggesting that the clientele were in a place where movies are shown. Therefore, we can eliminate options (A) house, (B) offices, (C) book store, and (D) car. The most likely answer is (E) movie theatre."
1908,"The aisle that John was on had macaroni, rice, and hamburger helper. What sort of store is John most likely shopping at?","['grocery store', 'church', 'drugstore', 'hardware store', 'department store']",grocery store,"9. John was shopping in an aisle that had food items like macaroni, rice, and hamburger helper. The options are grocery store, church, drugstore, hardware store, and department store. Church, drugstore, hardware store, and department store are not typically places where you would find a variety of food items like macaroni, rice, and hamburger helper. Therefore, we can eliminate options (B) church, (C) drugstore, (D) hardware store, and (E) department store. The most likely answer is (A) grocery store, as it is a common place to find a range of food items."
1909,"The all decided to sit down on the stools, and each order a what?","['mindset', 'fart', 'relax', 'find seat', 'drink']",drink,"10. The question states that they all decided to sit down on stools and order something. The options are mindset, fart, relax, find seat, and drink. Mindset refers to a person's mental outlook or attitude and is not related to sitting on stools and ordering something. Fart is an inappropriate or unrelated option and can be eliminated. Relax and find seat are possible activities when sitting down, but they do not specifically relate to ordering something. Drink matches the context of the question, as people often order drinks when sitting down in a setting with stools. Therefore, the most likely answer is (E) drink."
1910,"The all star was still playing ball in the championship, he wasn't one hundred percent because of a what?","['having fun', 'pleasure', 'trauma', 'injury', 'throwing']",injury,"1.
The all star was still playing ball in the championship, he wasn't one hundred percent because of a what? 

In this question, we are looking for the reason why the all star player was not at full strength during the championship. The options given are having fun, pleasure, trauma, injury, throwing.

Conditional statements:
- If the all star player was having fun, it would not be a valid reason for him not being at full strength because playing in a championship game requires focus and dedication.
- If the all star player was experiencing pleasure, it would not be a valid reason for him not being at full strength because pleasure alone does not explain his physical condition.
- If the all star player had trauma, it could be a valid reason for him not being at full strength because trauma can lead to physical and emotional distress.
- If the all star player had an injury, it is a valid reason for him not being at full strength because injuries can impact performance.
- If the all star player was throwing, it would not be a valid reason for him not being at full strength because throwing alone does not explain his physical condition.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is (D) injury because it is the only option that would logically explain why the player was not one hundred percent during the championship game. "
1911,"The alley cats were all beginning to gather together, but one loud crash sent them all what?","['disburse', 'charming', 'scattering', 'spread', 'dispense']",scattering,"
2.
The alley cats were all beginning to gather together, but one loud crash sent them all what? 

In this question, we are trying to identify what happened to the alley cats after a loud crash. The options given are disburse, charming, scattering, spread, dispense.

Conditional statements:
- If the alley cats disbursed, it would be a valid action after a loud crash because they might scatter in different directions.
- If the alley cats were charming, it would not be a valid action after a loud crash because charm does not explain their actions.
- If the alley cats scattered, it would be a valid action after a loud crash because scattering suggests that they went in different directions.
- If the alley cats spread, it would be a valid action after a loud crash because they could have spread out or moved away from the crash site.
- If the alley cats dispensed, it would not be a valid action after a loud crash because dispense does not explain their actions.

Answer: (C) clap. The statement mentions that the band enjoyed their success and fans and loved to do something at the start of every concert. While celebrating and hearing the crowd go mad may be mentioned, they are not directly linked to the starting of a concert. Clapping, on the other hand, is a common action performed by both the band and the audience at the beginning of a concert."
1960,"The band was performing live, but if you looked close enough you'd realize the sound was previously what?","['animated', 'broadcast', 'recorded', 'mixed', 'neutral']",recorded,"1. Conditional reasoning:

1963,"The barn was torn to shreds and all the pieces of board became one projectile after another flying through the air, it was a powerful what?","['tornado', 'weapon', 'baseball', 'air', 'canon']",tornado,"4. Conditional reasoning:
- If the barn was torn to shreds and pieces of board became one projectile after another flying through the air, then it was a result of a powerful force.
- If the barn was torn to shreds and pieces of board became one projectile after another flying through the air, then it was not caused by a baseball or air.

- If the bathroom is dirty and messy even though it is cleaned every day, then it might be located in a place where cleanliness is not prioritized or maintained.

1968,"The beautiful women walked up and down the catwalk, the cameras flashed and everybody was enjoying the what?","['performance', 'theater', 'fashion show', 'construction site', 'theatre']",fashion show,"9. Conditional reasoning:
- If beautiful women are walking up and down the catwalk and cameras are flashing, then it suggests a specific type of event.
- If beautiful women are walking up and down the catwalk and cameras are flashing, then it is unlikely to be a theater or construction site.

1969,"The beaver swam through the country he symbolized, where was he likely to be?","['japan', 'ontario', 'washington', 'woodlands', 'books']",ontario,"10. Conditional reasoning:
- If a beaver is swimming through the country it symbolizes, then it should be located in a country that has a connection or association with beavers.
- If a beaver is swimming through the country it symbolizes, then it should not be swimming in Japan, Washington, or near books.

1970,"The bedroom is pretty much the only room, that's the common layout where?","['dwelling', 'apartment', 'bed and breakfast', 'at hotel', 'loft']",at hotel,"1. The question states that the bedroom is pretty much the only room that has this common layout. So, we can eliminate options (A) dwelling, (C) bed and breakfast, and (E) loft, as they typically have more than just a bedroom.

So, we can eliminate options (C) sky and (E) apiary, as they are not specific locations. Option (A) Michigan is a specific location known for its cold winters, so it is a possibility. However, the more general and likely answer is (B) United States, as there are many regions within the United States that experience cold winters."

We can eliminate options (A) playground, (D) theater, and (E) convenience store, as they are not appropriate locations for a troublemaker to be in.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) lowering prices, as that is the action the bill failed to force the companies into."
1975,"The billionaire donated a large sum to his former college, this allowed them to construct a new science what?","['fraternity house', 'bank', 'big town', 'big city', 'building']",building,"6.

1978,"The bird is young and still nesting, what is it likely to do soon?","['spread wings', 'learn to fly', 'squawk', 'swim', 'attempt to fly']",attempt to fly,"9. The question states that the bird is young and still nesting, and it is likely to do something soon. We can eliminate options (A) spread wings, (C) squawk, and (D) swim, as they are not commonly associated with birds moving on from nesting.

1979,"The bird was tired, where did it land?","['cage', 'sky', 'on the head of a man', 'roof', 'countryside']",roof,"10. The question states that the bird was tired and asks where it landed.

The correct answer is (C) win. The statement mentions that the board game instructed players to conquer their opponent. In the context of a board game, the objective is usually to win.

1985,"The body guard was good at his duties, he made the person who hired him what?","['better job', 'irritated', 'feel safe', 'save money', 'headache']",feel safe,"6. The correct answer is (C) feel safe. The statement mentions that the bodyguard was good at his duties.

1990,"The botanist knew the plant was living, what did he observe that led him to know that?","['interaction', 'death', 'respiration', 'expiration', 'chlorophyll']",respiration,"1. The botanist knew the plant was living because he observed respiration. The process of respiration is a characteristic of living organisms, where they take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide to produce energy. Death, expiration, and chlorophyll are not direct indicators of a living plant. Interaction is too vague and does not specifically refer to a characteristic of living organisms."
1991,"The boy had a lot of might, but he had something else, and the villain learned how to exploit his what?","['definitely', 'weak', 'weakness', 'wont', 'will']",weakness,"2. The boy had a lot of might, but the villain learned how to exploit his weakness. The word ""exploit"" suggests that the villain took advantage of a vulnerability or flaw in the boy. Definitely, wont, and will do not convey a sense of exploitation. Weakness is the correct answer because it implies a lack of strength or vulnerability."
1992,"The boy is good at making friends, what happens as an immediate and obvious result?","['popularity', 'having friends', 'happiness', 'conflict', 'good feeling']",having friends,"3. As an immediate and obvious result of the boy being good at making friends, the outcome would be popularity. The term ""popularity"" directly correlates with being good at making friends. While having friends, happiness, conflict, and a good feeling can be potential consequences of making friends, they may not necessarily be immediate or obvious results."
1993,"The boy pondered commititng suicide, but didn't think of the consequences, what would he do should he carry though with it?","['extreme pain', 'die', 'dying', 'interruption', 'sit down']",die,"4. If the boy were to carry through with committing suicide, the consequence would be his death.

1994,"The boy was popular, but because of the things he liked he was considered a bit of a what?","['disliked', 'weirdo', 'nerdy', 'unknown', 'geek']",geek,"5. The boy was considered a bit of a weirdo because of the things he liked. The term ""weirdo"" implies that he was perceived as different or unconventional. Disliked, nerdy, unknown, and geek may not capture the aspect of being perceived as unconventional or different."
1995,"The boy was too nervous to dance, so what was he doing progressively at the ball?","['dance like crazy', 'standing still', 'wallflower', 'stand still', 'like dancing']",standing still,"6. The boy was too nervous to dance, so he progressively became a wallflower at the ball. The term ""wallflower"" refers to someone who observes or remains on the sidelines without actively participating, particularly in a social setting like a dance. Dance like crazy, standing still, stand still, and like dancing do not accurately reflect the boy's progressive behavior at the ball."
1996,"The boy's mind was not right.  He couldn't care for himself, so he had to be what?","['play tricks on', 'form images', 'tended', 'michigan', 'mindblown']",tended,"7. The boy's mind was not right, and he couldn't care for himself, so he had to be tended. The word ""tended"" suggests that someone had to take care of him due to his inability to care for himself. Play tricks on, form images, michigan, and mindblown do not accurately represent the act of caring for someone."
1997,"The broadcast studio had a booth set up for interviews, the host sat down and adjusted his what so the audience could hear?","['large room', 'microphone', 'guest speaker', 'radio station', 'television station']",microphone,"8. The host sat down and adjusted his microphone so the audience could hear. In a broadcast studio, a microphone is the most appropriate answer for a device that captures audio for the audience to hear. Large room, guest speaker, radio station, and television station are not directly related to adjusting for audience audio."
1998,"The brothers were punching angrily, why would they do that?","['cause pain', 'to defend themselves.', 'broken bones', 'bruise', 'pain for']",cause pain,"9. The brothers were punching angrily to defend themselves. The act of punching angrily suggests a defensive response to protect against perceived threats or aggression.

1999,"The buffalo was hunted until it was scare, but after much effort and many years they are now what again?","['available', 'endangered', 'plentiful', 'common', 'abundant']",abundant,"10. After much effort and many years, buffaloes are now plentiful again. The term ""plentiful"" indicates that there is a large quantity or abundance of buffaloes. Available, endangered, common, and abundant are not specific enough to indicate an increase in buffalo population after being hunted."
2000,"The buffalo were big thick and easy to spot, but the were hunted to the point that their numbers were what?","['thin', 'stomach', 'clear', 'sparse', 'thickskin']",sparse,"1. Given that the buffalo were big, thick, and easy to spot, but their numbers were affected by hunting, we can infer that their numbers were likely reduced or decreased. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) sparse because the term ""sparse"" means thinly scattered or in small numbers."
2001,"The building could accommodate many people.  The entrance hall alone was impressive, being wide enough to admit a hundred shoulder to shoulder.  But the building was owned by a billionaire and used only for his personal entertainment.  How would you describe this place?","['convention center', 'public building', 'large building', 'school', 'town hall']",large building,"2. The description provided states that the building could accommodate many people and was owned by a billionaire for personal entertainment. Based on this information, it is unlikely that the building would be a convention center, public building, school, or town hall, as these are typically used by the public for various purposes. The most appropriate choice would be (C) large building since it highlights the capacity of the building and its exclusive use by the owner."
2002,"The building was ready for flooring, and that's where the flooring who came in to the picture?","['builders', 'architect', 'target', 'tornado', 'tradesmen']",tradesmen,"3.

The question suggests that the buildings were designed to hold a lot of people, indicating a need for a larger space where they can be built. While small, in a hole, university, and town are all viable options, the most suitable choice is (C) large city. Large cities typically have the infrastructure and facilities to accommodate a large number of people, making them the logical choice for constructing buildings of this kind."

The statement describes an old bull with enough energy for sexual activity and states that it wasn't something. Given the provided choices, we can eliminate charge rider and bullbleep as they are not relevant to the context. Similarly, female and cow do not provide a negative aspect to contrast with the bull's energy. The correct answer is (E) feeble because it contrasts with the notion that the bull still had enough energy despite being old."
2005,"The bully said mean words, what was the affect on others?","['mean many things', 'hurt people', 'hurtful', 'ring true', 'fighting']",hurt people,"6. The question asks about the effect of a bully's mean words on others. While mean many things, fighting, and ring true may be outcomes of bullying, they are not directly mentioned in the question.

2006,"The bungalow overlooked a sidewalk and welcomed spontaneous interaction, where was it located?","['suburbia', 'gated community', 'suburbs', 'neighborhood', 'woods']",neighborhood,"7. The question describes a bungalow that overlooks a sidewalk and encourages spontaneous interaction. Considering the choices, a gated community and woods are not suitable options since they do not align with the context of the question. While suburbia and suburbs are related to residential areas, the most fitting choice is (D) neighborhood since it implies a closer-knit community and higher chances of social interaction with the sidewalk."
2007,"The bus stop implemented a size restriction for luggage, where was the bus stop going?","['boarding bus', 'city', 'fast', 'urban area', 'airport']",airport,"8. The question mentions that the bus stop implements a size restriction for luggage and asks where the bus stop is going. The choices ""boarding bus,"" ""fast,"" and ""airport"" are incorrect because they do not provide any relevant information about the destination of the bus stop.

2008,"The bus stop was downtown, who likely is responsible for operating it?","['city', 'urban area', 'towns', 'bus operator', 'airport']",city,"9. The question states that the bus stop is located downtown and asks about the responsible party for operating it. While towns and urban areas can have bus stops, they do not specifically align with the context of the question, which mentions downtown.

The correct answer is (A) baking soda. We can reason this out because the pioneer went to the general store for baking supplies, and among the choices, baking soda is the option that specifically relates to baking. The other choices (barrels, pepper, salt, small town) do not fit the context of baking supplies."
2630,"The pioneer went to the general store for food preservation supplies, what was he looking for?","['barrels', 'checkers', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'water']",salt,"1. The pioneer went to the general store for food preservation supplies, what was he looking for?

Answer: (A) barrels, (B) checkers, (C) baking soda, (D) salt, (E) water 

To answer this question, we need to think about the purpose of food preservation supplies. Barrels are commonly used for storing and preserving food, so they could be a plausible answer. Checkers, baking soda, and water are not typically used for food preservation. Salt, on the other hand, is a well-known ingredient for preserving food. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is (D) salt.

"
2631,"The pizza crust was very broad and large in circumference, but it was crispy and what?","['skinny', 'slender', 'broadtail', 'slim', 'thin']",thin,"

2. The pizza crust was very broad and large in circumference, but it was crispy and what?

Answer: (A) skinny, (B) slender, (C) broadtail, (D) slim, (E) thin 

The statement describes a pizza crust that is broad and large in circumference, indicating that it is not skinny or slender. ""Broadtail"" is not a commonly used term to describe a pizza crust, so it can be eliminated as a choice. The crust is described as crispy, which suggests that it is not slim. The correct answer is (E) thin because a thin crust can still be broad and large in circumference while also being crispy.

"
2632,"The place felt wrong, but higher up had said this was the right what?","['job', 'map', 'location', 'line', 'almost anywhere']",location,"

3. The place felt wrong, but higher up had said this was the right what?

Answer: (A) job, (B) map, (C) location, (D) line, (E) almost anywhere 

The statement suggests that someone in a higher position had declared this place to be the ""right"" something. Job and line do not fit the context of the sentence. While almost anywhere is a possibility, it is not a specific descriptor like job or location. Map seems out of place because it does not align with the given context either. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) location, as it is the most fitting choice for someone to deem a place as right.

"
2633,"The place specialized in colorful arrangements, but the also had a toy balloon or two where?","['see work', 'birthday party', 'flower shop', 'parade', 'toy store']",flower shop,"

4. The place specialized in colorful arrangements, but they also had a toy balloon or two where?

Answer: (A) see work, (B) birthday party, (C) flower shop, (D) parade, (E) toy store 

This question asks where one might find a place that specializes in colorful arrangements but also has toy balloons. A see work is an incorrect phrase and is not relevant to the question. A birthday party might have colorful arrangements and balloons, but it is not a specialized place. A flower shop specializes in colorful arrangements but does not necessarily have toy balloons. A parade does not fit the context of the question. A toy store is likely to specialize in colorful arrangements and also have toy balloons. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) toy store.

"
2634,"The place was special to them, you couldn't find it on just any what?","['map', 'device', 'area', 'almost anywhere', 'location']",map,"

5. The place was special to them, you couldn't find it on just any what?

Answer: (A) map, (B) device, (C) area, (D) almost anywhere, (E) location 

The statement suggests that the place being referred to is not easily found or accessible. Almost anywhere and location do not fit the context of the sentence. A map and a device could potentially help in finding a place, but they are not exclusive to this specific situation. The correct answer is (C) area because it implies that the place is unique and not easily discoverable within a general region or vicinity.

"
2635,"The plane taxied onto the runway with lots of civilians inside, where was it bound?","['city', 'school', 'military base', 'bowling alley', 'airfield']",city,"

6. The plane taxied onto the runway with lots of civilians inside, where was it bound?

Answer: (A) city, (B) school, (C) military base, (D) bowling alley, (E) airfield 

This question asks where a plane carrying civilians might be bound. A city and a school do not make sense in this context. A military base is a possibility if the civilians were involved in a military operation, but it is not explicitly stated. A bowling alley is unrelated to the given scenario. An airfield is the most logical choice as it is where planes take off and land, and it can accommodate the landing of a civilian plane. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) airfield.

"
2636,"The planned sky scraper was still years away from completion, but excavation had begun where?","['cemetary', 'mountain', 'desert', 'construction site', 'archeological site']",construction site,"

7. The planned skyscraper was still years away from completion, but excavation had begun where?

Answer: (A) cemetery, (B) mountain, (C) desert, (D) construction site, (E) archeological site 

The statement implies that excavation has started for the construction of a planned skyscraper. A cemetery and a mountain do not fit the context of the question. While a desert is not impossible for construction, it is not a specific location mentioned in the question. An archaeological site is also unrelated to the given scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) construction site, as it is the most logical choice for the location where excavation would begin for a planned skyscraper.

"
2637,"The plant suffered in the shade, where did it need to be planted instead?","['brightness', 'sunny delight', 'direct sunlight', 'bright light', 'tanning']",direct sunlight,"

8. The plant suffered in the shade, where did it need to be planted instead?

Answer: (A) brightness, (B) sunny delight, (C) direct sunlight, (D) bright light, (E) tanning 

The statement suggests that the plant did not thrive in a shaded area. Brightness, sunny delight, and tanning are not appropriate choices for where a plant needs to be planted. While bright light is a possible answer, it is not as specific as direct sunlight. The plant requires direct sunlight for optimal growth. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) direct sunlight.

"
2638,"The plants are hungry, what do they need to do for satiation?","['reproduce asexually', 'dont drink water', 'bear fruits and vegetables', 'photosynthesis', 'grow tall']",photosynthesis,"

9. The plants are hungry, what do they need to do for satiation?

Answer: (A) reproduce asexually, (B) don't drink water, (C) bear fruits and vegetables, (D) photosynthesis, (E) grow tall 

The statement suggests that plants are hungry and need something to satisfy their hunger. Reproducing asexually and growing tall are not actions that would satiate the hunger of plants. While photosynthesis is essential for the survival of plants, it does not address their hunger directly. Not drinking water is unrelated to the context of the question. Bearing fruits and vegetables is the most appropriate answer as it indicates that the plants need to produce food to satisfy their hunger. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) bear fruits and vegetables.

"
2639,"The plate was an antique, where did the man buy it?","['kitchen cupboard', 'flea market', 'big box store', 'dishwasher', 'restaurant']",flea market,"

10. The plate was an antique, where did the man buy it?

Answer: (A) kitchen cupboard, (B) flea market, (C) big box store, (D) dishwasher, (E) restaurant 

This question asks where a man might have bought an antique plate. A kitchen cupboard and a dishwasher do not make sense in this context. A big box store is unlikely to sell antique items. A restaurant is also unlikely to be the place where the man acquired the antique plate. The most plausible option is a flea market, as they are known for selling a variety of old and unique items, including antiques. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) flea market.

<end>"
2640,"The plate was dirty, where did the woman put it?","['garbage', 'kitchen cupboard', 'table', 'flea market', 'dishwasher']",dishwasher,"1. Given the statement 'The plate was dirty', we can infer that the woman wanted to clean it. Therefore, it is reasonable to eliminate choices such as flea market or garbage. The most logical place for her to put the dirty plate would be in the dishwasher, as that is where dirty plates are typically placed to be cleaned. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) dishwasher."
2641,"The plates needed to be stored in their proper place, which was where?","['ironing board', 'restaurant', 'table', 'stomach', 'shelf']",shelf,"2. The question states that the plates needed to be stored in their proper place. This implies that there is a specific designated place for the plates to be stored. Choices such as ironing board or restaurant do not make sense as proper storage places for plates. The most logical answer would be (E) shelf, as shelves are commonly used to store plates. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) shelf."
2642,"The play was nearly starting, everybody took their seat in the what?","['show', 'in cinema', 'theatre', 'bench', 'martorell']",theatre,"3. The statement suggests that a play is about to start and everyone needs to take their seat. The options show, in cinema, and martorell do not provide seating options for a play. While a bench can be a seating option, it is uncommon to have a bench in a theater specifically for a play. The most likely place for people to take their seat in a play is a (C) theater. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) theater."
2643,"The playroom had many classic toys, the child spilled out each and every plastic monkey out of the what?","['captivity', 'puzzle', 'barrel', 'thailand', 'rain forest']",barrel,"4. The statement mentions a playroom with classic toys, and a child spilling out plastic monkeys. Given this context, choices such as captivity, puzzle, and thailand do not fit. While a rain forest can be a setting for monkeys, it does not make sense for a child to spill out plastic monkeys from a rain forest. The most logical option would be (C) barrel, as toys are often stored in barrels. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) barrel."
2644,"The poet needed to write about his distant past, where did he have to go to do so?","['garden', 'bathroom', 'classroom', 'home', 'university']",home,"5. The question suggests that the poet needed to write about their distant past. The options bathroom and classroom do not align with the context of writing about one's past. While a garden may be a peaceful place to reflect, it is not explicitly mentioned that the poet needed to write. The most likely place for the poet to go in order to write about their distant past would be (D) home, as it provides a private and comfortable environment for reflection and writing. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) home."
2645,"The poet wanted to promote his new literature to literary majors, where did he go to do so?","['classroom', 'book store', 'university', 'study', 'home']",university,"6. The statement indicates that the poet wanted to promote their new literature to literary majors. Choices such as book store, study, and home do not provide a specific audience of literary majors. While a classroom can be a setting for literary majors, it is not explicitly mentioned that the poet was giving a lecture or presentation. The most logical option would be (C) university, as universities often have programs for literary studies and a concentration of literary majors. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) university."
2646,"The poet was being analyzed by younger people, where was this happening?","['book store', 'university', 'home', 'classroom', 'speakeasy']",classroom,"7. The question states that the poet was being analyzed by younger people. This indicates that it was happening in a setting where younger people gather. While a book store or classroom can have younger people, it is not specified that the analysis was happening in those locations. A speakeasy is not typically a place for analytical discussions. The most suitable option would be (B) university, as universities often have younger students engaging in analytical discussions. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) university."
2647,"The poet was being discussed amoung teenagers using Socratic dialogue, where was this happening?","['unemployment line', 'library', 'home', 'classroom', 'university']",classroom,"8. The statement mentions that the poet was being discussed among teenagers using Socratic dialogue. While an unemployment line or home can have discussions, they do not align with the context of a Socratic dialogue or specifically with teenagers. A library is a possible option as it is a place of intellectual discussions, but it is not explicitly mentioned that it was a library. The most appropriate location for a Socratic dialogue among teenagers would be (D) classroom, as classrooms are often used for educational discussions and Socratic method is commonly used in educational settings. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) classroom."
2648,"The poker player was not gaining money on the night, what was he doing instead?","['loosing', 'broke', 'lost', 'loss', 'waste']",loosing,"9. The question states that the poker player was not gaining money on the night. From this statement, we can infer that the poker player was experiencing a negative outcome. Choices such as broke or loss can be seen as negative outcomes, but they do not specifically convey the action of not gaining money. While waste can be seen as a negative outcome, it does not specifically relate to the context of the poker game. The most appropriate option would be (C) lost, as it implies that the poker player did not win any money. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) lost."
2649,"The police busted down his door, he realized only then he was just the pawn in his partner's grander what?","['scheme', 'chess game', 'chess set', 'business idea', 'playing chess']",scheme,"10. The statement mentions the police busting down the door and the realization of being a pawn. This implies that the person was involved in a larger plan or scheme orchestrated by their partner. While playing chess or owning a chess set can involve pawns, it does not connect to the context of the police and a grander plan. Choices such as business idea or chess game can be related to grander plans but lack the specific reference to pawns. The most fitting option is (A) scheme, as it directly aligns with the context of a larger plan involving pawns. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) scheme."
2650,"The police didn't pay any favors, their job was to what?","['force law', 'board vessels', 'arrest', 'arm weapons', 'direct traffic']",force law,"1.
The statement ""The police didn't pay any favors"" indicates that the police were not doing something beneficial or advantageous for someone. Therefore, their job was not to 'force law' or 'board vessels' as these choices are unrelated to giving or receiving favors. 'Arresting' criminals, 'arming weapons', and 'directing traffic' can be seen as actions that the police would do to fulfill their job duties. However, since the statement does not mention any specific criminal activity or traffic situation, it is safe to assume that the correct answer is 'arrest' since it is a general responsibility of the police.

"
2651,"The police had been stumped for years, the grieving family hired a private investigator in a hope to what?","['notice physical evidence', 'arrest criminal', 'gather evidence', 'discover truth', 'gathering facts']",discover truth,"2.
The statement ""The police had been stumped for years"" implies that the police were unable to solve a certain problem or case. The family then hired a private investigator in hope to achieve a particular outcome. 'Noticing physical evidence' seems like a passive action that does not involve actively solving the case, so it can be eliminated as a choice. 'Arresting a criminal' would be the desired outcome, but since the police were stumped, they did not know who the criminal was, which makes this choice unlikely. 'Gathering evidence' and 'gathering facts' are similar actions that involve collecting information to potentially solve the case. However, 'gathering evidence' specifically focuses on collecting proof or confirming suspicions, making it a more suitable choice. Lastly, 'discovering the truth' is a broad statement that could include any possible outcome, so it is less specific than 'gathering evidence'. Therefore, the correct answer is 'gather evidence'.

2652,"The police man was waving flares, what did he do with the impatient car?","['book robber', 'he had a word with the driver.', 'believe guilty', 'direct traffic', 'wave on']",wave on,"3.
The statement ""The police man was waving flares"" suggests that the police officer was trying to get the attention or convey a message to the driver of the impatient car. The phrase ""book robber"" does not make sense in this context and can be eliminated. ""Believe guilty"" is also unrelated as it does not indicate any suspicion of a crime. ""Direct traffic"" would not be a suitable action for a single impatient car, as it implies controlling a larger flow of vehicles. ""He had a word with the driver"" is the most appropriate choice as it indicates a direct interaction between the police officer and the driver. Lastly, ""wave on"" suggests allowing the car to continue moving forward without any further action from the police officer. Therefore, the correct answer is ""he had a word with the driver"".

"
2653,"The police saw the moving car, what did they know the suspect was doing?","['driving', 'breathing', 'getting tired', 'ticket', 'accidents']",driving,"4.
The statement ""The police saw the moving car"" implies that the police had visual confirmation of a car in motion. From this information, we can infer that the police knew what the suspect was doing. ""Breathing"" and ""getting tired"" are not actions directly related to a moving car and can be eliminated. ""Ticketing"" would require the police to have a reason or a violation committed by the suspect, which is not specified in the statement. ""Accidents"" is a broad term that could happen during driving, but it does not specifically describe what the suspect was doing. Therefore, the correct answer is ""driving"".

"
2654,"The police were well liked and respected, it was easier for them to interact with the community since it was a small what?","['direct traffic', 'give tickets', 'donut shop', 'town', 'wrong place']",town,"5.
The statement ""The police were well liked and respected"" suggests that the police had a positive reputation within their community. It was also easier for them to interact with the community because it was a small something. ""Direct traffic"" and ""give tickets"" are actions performed by the police, not characteristics of the community. ""Donut shop"" is a specific location and does not represent the community as a whole. ""Wrong place"" is not related to the positive reputation of the police. ""Town"" is the most suitable choice, as it represents a small community in which the police can easily interact with its members. Therefore, the correct answer is ""town"".

"
2655,"The policemen wanted to clear the scene of the accident, so what did they do to traffic?","['hurry along', 'direct traffic', 'help', 'force open door', 'corner thief']",hurry along,"6.
The statement ""The policemen wanted to clear the scene of the accident"" indicates the objective of the police. It can be inferred that the police wanted to do something with traffic to fulfill this objective. ""Hurry along"", ""help"", ""force open door"", and ""corner thief"" are actions that are unrelated to clearing the scene of an accident. ""Direct traffic"" is the most suitable choice, as it implies controlling the flow of vehicles to ensure a safe and efficient clearance of the accident scene. Therefore, the correct answer is ""direct traffic"".

"
2656,"The politician promised money, what was he hoping to do?","['buy party', 'increase power', 'settle everything', 'control people', 'buy food']",control people,"7.
The statement ""The politician promised money"" implies that the politician made a commitment or assurance involving money. From this, we can deduce that the politician was hoping to achieve a desired outcome. ""Buy party"" does not make sense in this context and can be eliminated. ""Settle everything"" and ""buy food"" are not specific enough to understand the desired outcome related to money. ""Increase power"" suggests that the politician wants to gain more influence or authority, which aligns with seeking a higher position or enhanced political standing. ""Control people"" can be seen as a way to achieve increased power, but it is not directly related to the promise of money. Therefore, the correct answer is ""increase power"".
  
"
2657,"The portly man was having lunch, he ate so fast he didn't chew small enough pieces and sure enough began to what?","['choke', 'getting full', 'burp', 'eat food', 'regurgitating']",choke,"8.
The statement ""The portly man ate so fast he didn't chew small enough pieces"" suggests that the man's fast eating caused an issue with his actions. From this, we can infer the consequence or reaction to his eating behavior. ""Eating food"" is already mentioned in the statement as the initial action and does not represent a consequence. ""Getting full"" is a normal response to eating, but it does not indicate any specific problem caused by the man's eating speed. ""Burping"" is a common physiological reaction to excessive air intake during eating, but it is not strongly associated with not chewing small enough pieces. ""Regurgitating"" indicates the act of vomiting or throwing up, which is a more severe consequence and aligns with not properly chewing food. Therefore, the correct answer is ""choke"".

"
2658,"The potato wants to grow, where should it be placed?","['pantry', 'paper bag', 'underground', 'boiling water', 'drawer']",underground,"9.
The statement ""The potato wants to grow"" suggests that the potato needs to be placed in a specific environment or condition that promotes its growth. From this, we can deduce where the potato should be placed to facilitate its growth. ""Pantry"" is a storage area for food and is not suitable for growing a potato. ""Paper bag"" is commonly used to store potatoes, but it does not provide ideal conditions for the potato to grow. ""Boiling water"" and ""drawer"" are not suitable environments for the growth of a potato either. ""Underground"" is the most suitable choice, as it represents the natural growing environment for a potato where it can receive enough moisture, warmth, and protection for optimal growth. Therefore, the correct answer is ""underground"".

"
2659,"The potato was sliced and  fried by the cook, what was he looking to make?","['potatoes', 'root cellar', 'french fries', 'prince edward island', 'main course']",french fries,"10.
The statement ""The potato was sliced and fried by the cook"" indicates the actions performed by the cook on the potato. From this, we can deduce what the cook was aiming to create with the potato. ""Potatoes"" is the plural form of the initial ingredient and does not indicate the intended dish. ""Root cellar"" is a storage place for vegetables and does not represent a dish made from potatoes. ""French fries"" is a common dish made by slicing potatoes into thin strips and frying them, which matches the actions described in the statement. ""Prince Edward Island"" is not relevant to the context of the question and can be eliminated. ""Main course"" is a general term referring to a substantial dish served during a meal, which does not specifically indicate the use of potatoes. Therefore, the correct answer is ""French fries""."

2831,"The teacher told her students to listen, what did she want from them?","['able to hear', 'concentrate', 'pay attention', 'stop talking', 'eyes on her']",pay attention,"2. The correct answer is (C) pay attention. If the teacher told her students to listen, it means she wanted them to actively engage with what was being said and focus their attention on it. Being able to hear is a basic capability that is needed for listening, but it does not capture the intention behind the teacher's instruction. Concentrate, stop talking, and keeping eyes on her are related actions that can facilitate listening, but the primary goal is to pay attention."
2832,"The teacher told the class they would be taking a lot of notes this semester, he recommended buying a what just for this class?","['school', 'meeting', 'notebook', 'meeting', 'desk']",notebook,"3.

The fact that the teacher took the children out of the playroom to change diapers indicates that she worked in a setting where young children are taken care of, such as a nursery school. While a big house, grandma's house, creche, and preschool can also be places where children are found, the context of changing diapers suggests a nursery school environment."
2835,"The teacher walked up and down the rows of seats checking the belts, then gave the okay for the what to leave?","['school', 'theatre', 'bus', 'hockey game', 'theater']",bus,"6. The correct answer is (C) bus. The teacher walking up and down the rows of seats checking the belts and giving the okay for something to leave implies that there is some form of transportation involved. School, theatre, and hockey game are not typically associated with belts and the act of checking them. While a theater can have rows of seats, it is unlikely that an okay would be given for the theater itself to leave. A bus, on the other hand, is commonly checked for seat belt compliance and is given permission to leave by the driver or a responsible person."
2836,"The teacher was arranging and sorting papers at her desk, needing paper clips she opened up the left what?","['work', 'drawer', 'university', 'desktop', 'window']",drawer,"7. The correct answer is (B) drawer. The teacher was sorting papers at her desk and needed paper clips, so logically she would open a drawer to find them.

2837,"The teacher was explaining how important it is to learn all you can, she said it can get you anywhere and is very what?","['intelligent', 'have more knowledge', 'increase knowledge', 'factual', 'empowering']",empowering,"8. The correct answer is (E) empowering. The teacher explained how important it is to learn all one can, stating that it can get you anywhere. This implies that learning has the power to empower individuals to achieve their goals and succeed in life. While being intelligent, having more knowledge, and increasing knowledge are related concepts, they do not fully capture the sense of empowerment that the teacher expressed. Factual, on the other hand, relates to the truthfulness and accuracy of knowledge, but it does not explicitly address the idea of empowerment."
2838,"The teacher was explaining the mammoth and the time it lived, he used terms foreign to the students to explain this such as what?","['pleistocene', 'museum of natural history', 'smithsonian institution', 'antarctica', 'old times']",pleistocene,"9. The correct answer is (A) Pleistocene. The teacher was explaining the mammoth and the time it lived and used terms that were foreign to the students. Pleistocene is a geological epoch that is directly related to the time when mammoths existed. While the museum of natural history and the Smithsonian Institution are institutions that have exhibits and information about natural history, they are not specific terms used to describe the time of the mammoths. Antarctica and old times are not directly related terms to the context of explaining the time period of the mammoth."

The correct answer is (B) body of water. The teacher was trying to describe what an island was to the young children and explained that it was a piece of land surrounded by something. Among the options, only a body of water fits this description as islands are typically formed by land surrounded by water. Hawaii is a specific location and not a general feature, and Niagra Falls and the Mississippi River are specific bodies of water rather than a general category like ""body of water."" The Pacific Ocean is a specific body of water, but the term ""body of water"" is a more general and inclusive term."

To determine how central banks go about fighting inflation, we can use conditional statements to reason through the choices. One common method for central banks to fight inflation is by tightening monetary policy, which involves reducing the money supply and increasing interest rates. Stealing, deflation, spending more, and problems are not likely to be effective strategies for fighting inflation.
